# Empirical-Topic-Modeling
With bulky volumes of information coming from various sources and with the large reports of data in front of the executives, it's really hard for anyone to go through them in a given time frame. So, in order to give a summary what the whole data is saying will make lives easier. In this page we are going to describe the process of analyzing huge corpus of data and how to interpret the topics in any given data.   Here we are going to demonstrate this by Scraping the data of three completely diverse topics from the Google search results. Mix all the data into one single corpus. After that, we should be able to distinguish and identify the topics that we picked from the results at the end of this exercise.
