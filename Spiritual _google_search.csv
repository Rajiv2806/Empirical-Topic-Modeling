One school of thought considers that definite?and conscious?evolutionary change is necessary for liberation; consequently meditation must be an actively transforming process. The other view is that the only thing needed for liberation is re-entry into our true, eternal nature. That nothing need be ?done? at all except to perceive the truth of ourselves.

Pick up a framework for how to live a life of meaning and discover more about the science of the mind and promote better holistic health . The book that is always popular for spiritual awakening is The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran. This is a life-changing read and a book you should keep referring to throughout your life. Share the Past ... We are all likely experience a busy life trying to juggle work and family and trying to fit in some kind of work life balance. It’s a crazy stressful world in which we live and the pace is often relentless. You probably struggle to find time to stop, deal with the stress and take stock of what is really important. Normally we are not taught how to deal with holstic health and are left to figure it out on our own. This is where books about spirituality and health can be very helpful. Continuing at the pace and not taking time to fuel our mind, body and spirit can result in burnout and eventually breakdowns. The more we try to carry on, the more our ability to perform deteriorates. It happens more than you might think. Spiritual books can help us to find our place in the universe and understand who we are and what we value. When you start to get clarity on this it makes coping with the world much easier and helps us better relate to others – a major source of problems for many people. A spiritual awakening could start with a book just by feeding those ideas into your daily thinking. Being able to lead a more principles based life and moving away from material thinking can be the start of centring ourselves. Putting all the stress around and confusion of daily life into context can be a major step forward. Can all this happen with a book? Sure. It’s about taking in new ideas, making time to put them into practice and finding what works for you. Spirituality and health books can act as a handbook to live by. Something to turn to when we are not sure of the next step or how to react to a certain situation. Especially difficult times like poor health, divorce, financial struggles and dealing with grief. Mind, Body and Spiritual Books 1 2 3 Next Page Although a book can’t solve everything it can put us on the right path to finding balance in our daily life and start helping us understand what makes us happy. We can discover new philosophies to live by and mantras to maintain positive outlook. Gain from other people’s experience of how they achieved spiritual awakening or dealt with difficulty. Many people are faced with poor health that conventional medicine can’t cure or has undesirable side effects. Holistic health books can offer alternatives to this and may, in some cases, improve the situation for the person. There are many book options out there. "

Video Post navigation ? Older posts “Jigs for Marriage and Celibacy” Posted by Wesley Hill 0 Happy Thanksgiving, dear readers! I know I speak for Ron and all the other contributors too when I say that we are so grateful to be in this virtual community with you all, and we’re thankful for every interaction we’ve had with you here. Just today, Comment magazine unlocked a piece I wrote for their latest print issue on “how to die in marriage and celibacy.” An excerpt: … Jesus goes on to discuss the matter of singleness, on which topic he is equally stringent. Don’t make the mistake, he seems to say to his followers, of thinking that if you opt out of marriage, you are thereby exempted from martyrdom. Whether one is unmarried due to a biological incapacity for spousal union or prevented from it by circumstances or embracing that state voluntarily, Jesus imagines the unwed as those whose lives are to be lived “for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (19:12). Christian singleness too, like Christian marriage, is not about “brief joy and long sadness,” to return to Luther’s quote above. It is instead one more way in which we begin to unlearn selfishness, to embrace a kind of spiritual martyrdom, and find our desires redirected toward the city of God. Singleness too is about holy dying, about the sanctifying transformation of desire and belonging. The whole piece is about how, whatever vocation we’re led into, it’s going to be a pathway of dying to our “old selves” and embracing our new life in Christ. As C. S. Lewis memorably put it, “Die before you die. There is no chance after.” Maybe it’s an odd thought for Thanksgiving Day, but I hope that it’s an encouraging one in a roundabout way. So many of you who stop by here to read and think with us are living this life of daily death-and-resurrection, and it inspires me to no end. Posted in celibacy , community , faith , marriage , perseverance , singleness , Uncategorized , vocation Nov · 24 Podcast: “Homosexuality and Christian Faithfulness” Posted by Wesley Hill 1 I recently sat down with Darrell Bock of Dallas Theological Seminary — well, sort of; I sat in my office and talked with him via Skype — and I wanted to share that conversation here. Darrell interviewed me about my Washed and Waiting and Spiritual Friendship books, and while there may not be a lot that’s new here if you’ve heard me talk before, maybe it’s still something a few of you might appreciate. Here’s the breakdown of the conversation: 00:56 Hill’s books and background 02:23 Same-sex attraction and the Christian 07:45 Hill’s book, Washed and Waiting 10:58 Sexuality in 1 Corinthians 6 and Romans 8 14:12 Hill’s conversation with this parents 17:35 How the church can minister to same-sex attracted and single people 20:10 Hill’s book, Spiritual Friendship 25:20 Jesus’ example of singleness and self-sacrifice 30:50 The concept of friendship 36:00 Three categories for friendship 39:27 Friendships with a deeper lever of commitment 41:35 The need for friendship 42:31 Multiple layers of friendships and serving together 43:32 Hospitality and staying connected Posted in books , celibacy , church , coming out , friendship , general , God , Uncategorized Nov · 23 A high school “AP Friendship” class? Posted by Jack Franicevich 3 My first earnest prayer was for a good friend. At eight years old, I developed a haunting sense that I didn’t fit in anywhere, and that insecurity only grew more intense through high school and into college. But what I discovered there floored me and, no, it wasn’t just the friendly people. In an honors Great Books program characterized just as much by intellectual joy as by rigor, students of all majors were mixed together and plunged into the most influential texts and the biggest questions of Western history. And after discussing enough modern epistemology, epic poetry, mystical theology, and Victorian literature in a room of political science, viola, anthropology, and business majors, I discovered the biggest idea I’ve ever seen. Our best discussions have been the ones in which we got to know the author, cared about what he or she cared about, and tried to discern the truth they communicated. My best job interviews have been the ones in which I have gotten to know the company, articulate my understanding of what they care about, and discussed how I could help them love what they care about. To read a book, have difficult conversations, and get a fitting job, all require that I become a good friend: to care about the other person, care about what they care about, and seek their good and the good of whatever they love. True friendship binds all things together . My most earnest prayer today is that I would continue to become a good friend. Today, I am a high school teacher, and it is my job to commission students to faithfully enter whatever comes next. But marriage is not a universal calling, nor is college. Nor is church ministry or a traditional job? So to what can I commission my students? To friendship with God and man. Continue reading ? Posted in books , church , community , culture , faith , friendship , God , hospitality , moral imagination , stories Nov · 02 On Christians Who Change Their Minds Posted by Wesley Hill 8 Over at First Things , I’ve got a new column on my frustration with the way the renowned Christian philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff went about making his case for same-sex marriage: Clearly, there exists in the church today the possibility of genuine, reasoned, substantive debate over the rightness of same-sex marriage. Some of the most humane and beautiful Christian writing I’ve read in recent years has come from same-sex-marriage advocates like the Episcopalian Eugene Rogers and the British feminist theologian Sarah Coakley . And that’s why Wolterstorff’s lecture is particularly dismaying: By firing cheap shots and caricaturing the traditional views he hopes to overturn, he hampers a debate whose depth and maturity could be further deepened. Wolterstorff is, of course, simply one more example of the way Christians of all stripes are switching “sides,” so to speak, and affirming same-sex marriage. The popular blogger Jen Hatmaker made the news just this past week for the same thing, and she stands in a long line that includes, to pick only a couple of more recent examples, ethicist David Gushee and New Testament scholar Daniel Kirk . There’s so much that could be said about this trend, and I tried to say a few constructive things in my column , but mainly I keep thinking about this post from my friend Alan Jacobs, written a couple of years ago now. Alan makes the point that if we, whether individual believers or churches or Christian organizations, change our views to affirm same-sex marriage because we think that’s what God has always affirmed , then that means we have to look back on all our long years of being non-affirming and view them as a capitulation to an ungodly cultural homophobia. We have to acknowledge that the church was—that we ourselves were—captive to an un-Christian way of approaching gay people for years upon years. Or if, like me, you think the historic Christian view of marriage is correct and that same-sex sexual practice is sinful, then you have to view all these recent changes of mind, like Nick Wolterstorff’s, as a similar sort of capitulation to culture, only in the opposite direction. And as Alan writes, that’s the key issue, it seems to me — that’s what churches and other Christian organizations need to be thinking about. Either throughout your history or at some significant point in your history you let your views on a massively important issue be shaped largely by what was acceptable in the cultural circles within which you hoped to be welcome. How do you plan to keep that from happening again? It’s a haunting question, to be sure. Posted in Bible , church , culture , disagreement , Uncategorized Nov · 02 Amid the Wreckage of the Christian Right Posted by Ron Belgau 8 Just before midnight on December 29, 1972, Eastern Airlines flight 401 was descending toward Miami International Airport with 176 souls on board. The night was a clear with no moon. When the pilots attempted to lower the landing gear, the green light indicating that the nose gear was down and locked failed to illuminate. They informed Air Traffic Control that they were aborting the landing, and requested a holding pattern. The controller directed them to climb and circle over the Everglades. Over the next few minutes, as the pilots sought to trouble-shoot the problem with the landing gear, they didn’t monitor their instruments, and so did not notice that the plane was slowly descending. Over the next several minutes, the crew became so focused on fixing the landing gear problem that they lost situational awareness. They weren’t paying attention to their altitude, and missed warning chimes informing them that the plane was drifting downwards. A few minutes later, the plane slammed into the Everglades, killing 99 of the passengers and crew on board; all of the survivors sustained injuries, most of them serious enough to require hospitalization. * * * Continue reading ? Posted in Bible , church , culture , disagreement , hope , perseverance , politics Oct · 24 True and False Friendship Posted by Ron Belgau 8 I saw the Graduate Reading Room in the Suzzallo Library for the first time during freshman orientation at the University of Washington—just a few hours before the fateful party where Jason and I discovered our mutual love of planes. As it turned out, the reading room has proven a happier and longer-lived companion. The reading room has always been a kind of academic cloister for me. As an undergraduate in the mid nineties, I had no cell phone, no laptop, no WiFi internet access. Once I settled into one of the comfortable armchairs at the end of the reading room, I was almost cut off from the outside world, left alone with my thoughts and my books. The architecture called to mind the great halls of Europe’s castles and sanctuaries of Europe’s cathedrals. It was easier to conjure up the past there than it was in the more utilitarian modern spaces of the libraries at Saint Louis University and the University of Notre Dame. I could feel people, places, and events come alive as I read there, in a way that they did not in my dorm room or a coffee shop or in the the fluorescent glare of the Hesburgh Library.

Posted by Ron Belgau 2 In After Virtue , the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre wrote that as humans are a “story-telling animal,” and goes on to say, “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’” Over the last week, I’ve written a lot about my experiences and the experiences of my friends. In different ways, each of those stories grappled with its relation to the larger Christian story. Through those stories, I’ve tried to sketch some part of the range of gay experience, from anonymous hook-ups to highly idealized unrequited love. Many Christians are suspicious of experience. They think that in our present fallen state, we are far too likely to be misled by our sinful desires, and that the only reliable source of moral judgment is found in the Bible or (for Catholics) in the Church’s teaching. Pope John Paul II offered a more nuanced view. The Theology of the Body is a collection of addresses given by Pope John Paul II in the late 1970s and early 1980s and addressed to understanding the body and human sexuality in light of the Gospel.

A combination of weather-related travel delays and getting feedback from my friend Chris delayed posting until now .] In the fall of 2009, I moved to South Bend for a year-long exchange at the University of Notre Dame’s Center for Philosophy of Religion. At the Ethics and Culture Conference that November, I met Chris Damian, a Notre Dame freshman interested in philosophy and theology. For the first couple of years after we met, we had interesting conversations when we ran into each other (which was not often) and exchanged occasional emails if one of us saw something we thought would interest the other. He was popular and charismatic, and I saw his natural leadership talents emerge as he immersed himself in pro-life activism and defending the faith on campus. After a couple of years passed like this, I was in South Bend again for a conference, and we arranged to meet for dinner. At some point in the conversation, we got into a discussion of homosexuality and changing sexual orientation. Chris thought Christians should talk more about hope for orientation change. I disagreed.

Augustine thinks that we are not drawn to God by necessity or under compulsion, but by love, even by desire: “Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart” (Psalm 37:4). Augustine reminds his readers of how lavishly the Scripture appeals to our sense of delight: “How precious is thy steadfast love, O God! The children of men take refuge in the shadow of thy wings. They feast on the abundance of thy house, and thou givest them drink from the river of thy delights. For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light do we see light” (Psalm 36:7-9). And this of course echoes what may be his most famous saying, found in the Confessions : “You have made us for Yourself, oh God, and our hearts are ever restless until they find rest in You.” The Confessions are an extended meditation on desire, on the many false objects of desire that Augustine pursued until he discovered that they could not truly satisfy the desire of his heart. * * * Continue reading ?

Typically, this question is quickly framed in terms of sexual ethics: should the Church bless same-sex marriage? Framed in this way the traditional answer—which I fully believe—is that the Church cannot bless same sex marriage, because both Old and New Testaments teach that gay sex is contrary both to God’s plan in creation and to His revealed law. I have written tens of thousands of words and participated in numerous public debates defending this position and responding to various revisionist arguments. But there is a danger here. In today’s Gospel reading, Christ says, “But woe to you Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the love of God” (Luke 11:42). Again, He says, “Woe to you lawyers also! for you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers” (Luke 11:46). Continue reading ?

In Braj region of India, where Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated for 16 days (until Rangpanchmi) in commemoration of the divine love of Radha for Krishna, a Hindu deity. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as festival of love. There is a symbolic myth behind commemorating Krishna as well. Baby Krishna transitioned into his characteristic dark blue skin colour because a she demon Putana poisoned him with her breast milk. In his youth, Krishna despairs whether fair skinned Radha and other Gopikas (girls) will like him because of his skin colour. His mother, tired of the desperation, asks him to approach Radha and colour her face in any colour he wanted. This he does, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. The playful colouring of the face of Radha has henceforth been commemorated as Holi Beyond India, these legends to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah) are common in some Caribbean and South American communities of Indian origin such as Holi is an important festival to Hindus. It is celebrated at the end of the winter season on the last full moon day of the lunar month Phalguna (February/March), (Phalgun Purnima), which usually falls in March, sometimes in late February. The festival has many purposes. First and foremost, it celebrates the beginning of the new season, spring. In 17th century literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring harvests and the fertile land. Hindus believe it is a time of enjoying spring's abundant colours and saying farewell to winter. Holi festivities mark the beginning of new year to many Hindus, as well as a justification to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end conflicts and accumulated emotional impurities from past It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit, known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, dance and sing. The next day, Holi, also known as Dhuli in Sanskrit, or Dhulheti, Dhulandi or Dhulendi, is celebrated. Children and youth spray coloured powder solutions (Gulal) at each other, laugh and celebrate, while elders tend to smear dry coloured powder (Abir) on each other's face. Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies, desserts and drinks. After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, visit friends and family. Like Holika Dahan, Kama Dahanam is celebrated in some parts of India. The festival of colours is these parts is called Rangapanchami, and occurs on fifth day after Panchami (full moon).

To raise awareness of the effect of global climate change on water, Balog films the world’s receding glaciers, often at great personal risk. View the trailer for his film Chasing Ice . 1 1. Tad Pfeffer Source: http://www.chasingice.com/contact/ Science helps us know the properties and function of water in the natural world. Ethics helps us decide how to preserve, protect, and distribute Earth’s water resources. Spirituality helps us identify our core convictions about the meaning and value of water. If we genuinely hold that water has intrinsic value, it will be demonstrated in how we act; our actions will express a spirituality of respect for Earth’s water resources. Conversely, if we routinely act in ways that misuse water, we will display an inner spirit that lacks respect for water–regardless of what we may say about its value. Paying attention to how we act puts us in closer touch with our operating spirituality; greater awareness of our inner spirit helps us identify the strengths of our true convictions. Along with identifying our core convictions, awareness of human spirituality opens us up to a deeper appreciation for the rich array of spiritual meanings other people and cultures have given to the natural world. This is a valuable resource for our own reflection on the meaning of the natural world and our place in it. This is especially true of water, a feature of the natural world that has been a centerpiece of spiritual symbolism [symbol]: In a religious sense, a thing that both stands for and points to something else and makes that which is being pointed to uniquely present. and religious ritual In a religious sense, a traditional and meaningful series of actions performed according to a prescribed order that serve to bring the participants in close relationship with the source of their religious experience. in human communities for thousands of years. With remarkable regularity across human cultures, water has been used to communicate the sacred The quality of an object that makes it of such a supreme value that it cannot be measured by human standards. value of life; the spiritual dimension of purification, protection, and healing; and the profound meaning of suffering and redemption In a religious sense, the experience of being saved from or changed out of a life of suffering caused by one’s immoral or sinful actions. in human life. This section begins with select examples of water use in the world’s religions and then returns to the question of our own spiritual understanding of water with special focus on the Christian tradition. In this approach, we follow the spirituality questions posed in the River Ganges case study that began this chapter: How have human beings approached the nature and meaning of water from a spiritual perspective? What aspects of our spirituality might we draw on to help us address the global water crisis? Water in Symbol and Ritual Flutist Ronald Roybal 1 1. Accessed 4/4/13 Source: http://www.ronaldroybal.com/press_kit Human beings have long been in awe of water. Its movement, its forms, its colors, its power--all these draw our attention, fascinate us, and sometimes spellbind us. We can stare at a running brook or overlapping, windswept waves and enter a mood of calm wonder. The physical properties of water that you studied in the science section–especially fluidity, solvency, and the hydrologic cycle–give water the features that evoke our awe. They also explain why humanity has so often used water as a sacred symbol. Symbol of Life Inspired People Tangiora [photo] Pauline Tangiora is a Maori elder from New Zealand and a world leader in environmental spirituality. Listen to her remarks on water at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Human beings have often taken water’s refreshing, fluid quality as a symbol of the power of life itself. Many Indigenous People Communities of human beings with distinct cultures linked to lands later colonized and settled by non-indigenous human groups. have understood water this way for thousands of years. Some of the most beautiful sacred music among indigenous tribes of North American celebrates the life-giving power of water. Listen to Ronald Roybal, a Pueblo Indian, celebrate this power in his performance of Where the Water Cuts Through on the Native American flute. Like the Pueblo Indians, the Navajo (Diné) people of the southwestern United States consider water the sacred center of life, “the heart of all that is”. Indigenous leaders from around the world were among the leaders at the UN Wings of Water Conference at the Hague Peace Palace, and they created the International Inter-religious Spiritual Manifesto on Water which emphasized the role of water in the spiritual lives of human beings worldwide. A 12 th century Christian mosaic depicting God calling forth life from the waters. From the Cathedral of Monreale in Sicily. 1 1. Courtesy of Rod Humby Source: www.thejoyofshards.co.uk In the creation story of the Jewish Torah and Christian Bible, God’s spirit first moved “over the face of the waters” and God said “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures” (Genesis 1:2, 20). In Islam The religious faith of Muslims, based on the words and religious system founded by the prophet Muhammad and taught by the Qur'an the basic principle of which is absolute submission to a unique and personal god, Allah. View Source http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/islam , water is the origin of all life on Earth. The Qur’an says water is the substance from which God created the human being (25:54). At creation, even God’s throne “was upon water” (11:7). Symbol of Purification, Protection and Healing We learned in the River Ganges case study at the beginning of this chapter that the Hindu [Hinduism]: An ancient and diverse religious and cultural tradition of Southeast Asia, characterized by the belief in reincarnation, one absolute being of multiple manifestations, the law of cause and effect, following the path of righteousness, and the desire for liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. people in India consider the river Ganges an embodiment of the goddess Ganga. This makes the Ganges River both a symbol of life and a place where one can wash away spiritual impurities, thereby drawing closer to the sacred source of life. Spiritual purification through ablution in Islam. 1 1. By User:Dantadd (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons Source: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AAblution.jpg In a similar way, ancient Jewish tradition calls people on special occasions to cleanse their bodies spiritually by immersion in a ‘mikveh’ bath. For Muslims, ablution with water, or wudu, is an obligatory preparation for daily prayer. The prophet Mohammed states in the Qur’an: ""O you who believe! When you rise up to prayer, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles” (5:6). These are only a few examples of the use of water for spiritual purification in the world’s religions. As with fluidity, human beings have found in water solvency a cleansing power that reaches beyond the physical body. Roman Catholics use holy water for spiritual protection. 1 1.

In Roman Catholic Christianity, for example, water can be ritually blessed and serve as a spiritual symbol of God’s protection over a person or group touched by this Holy Water. Symbolizing both purification and protection, Catholics often dip the fingers of their right hand into a Holy Water font and make a Sign of the Cross as they enter (purification) and leave (protection) a church. Many Eastern Orthodox A Christian church founded on the teachings and life of Jesus Christ and characterized by sacramental worship, multiple traditions of spiritual practice, and organized in a loose federation of patriarchies according primacy of honor to the patriarch of Constantinople. Christians also drink a small amount of blessed water when saying their morning prayers or put a little holy water in their food as they cook their meals. Inspired People Bartholomew [photo] Bartholomew I is the Archbishop of Constantinople, spiritual leader of the world’s 300 million Orthodox Christians. Bartholomew is known worldwide as the ‘Green Patriarch’ for his commitment to environmental sustainability. 1 1. Massimo Finizio [CC BY 3.0 ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0 )], via Wikimedia Commons Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_I_of_Constantinople Sacred healing practices in most world religions also involve water. For centuries, Eastern Orthodox Christians have identified certain springs of water as possessing healing power. One of the most renowned springs is at the Church of St. Mary of the Spring in Istanbul, Turkey. Here, in 450 AD, the future Byzantine Emperor Leo I encountered a thirsty blind man near a grove of trees. As he looked for water to give the man, Leo heard a voice say ""Leo, go into the grove, take the water which you will find and give it to the thirsty man. Then take mud and put it on the blind man's eyes. Afterwards, build a temple here so that all who come will find answers to their petitions.” Leo did as he was told and the blind man regained his sight. Leo erected a magnificent church on the site where its water is believed to work cures to this day. Closer Look video_camera_right [icon] For an interesting discussion of the verification process for the healing miracles at Lourdes, see The 67 Miracles of Lourdes . The most famous tradition of healing water in Roman Catholicism is that of Our Lady of Lourdes in France. In an apparition on February 25, 1858, Bernadette Soubirous was told by the Virgin Mary to dig in the ground until reaching water and then ""drink at the spring and wash in it”. Since this apparition, many people have claimed to be cured by drinking or bathing in the spring water discovered by Bernadette. Thousands of people come every year to the Grotto of Massabielle in the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes and follow the instructions given to Bernadette. Symbol of Movement from Separation to Redemption Religious traditions have also used the seasonal water cycle of drought, flood, life-giving rain, and the rainbow to symbolize the human experience of moving out of separation from God to redemption. In the Ancient Hebrew Torah and Christian Bible, God sent a great flood at the time of Noah because “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). God rewarded Noah returning to dry land. A 12 th century Christian mosaic from the Cathedral of Monreale in Sicily. 1 1. Courtesy of Rod Humby Source: www.thejoyofshards.co.uk Noah’s faithfulness with dry land and a covenant “between you and me and every living creature”. The rainbow was given as a sign of this covenant (Genesis 9:12-13). Later, the Ancient Hebrews again use the water cycle to symbolize their experience of moving from separation to redemption. The prophet Elijah’s first words announce a drought for the sins of Israel (1 Kings 17: 1). When the people of Israel stop their idolatry, God blesses them with “a great rain” (1 Kings 18:41-45). In Islam, too, water is a symbol for the stages of life’s journey. Most notably, at the end of the journey, believers will experience a garden of paradise containing cool streams and springs of fresh drinking water. As the Qur’an states, believers will enjoy “rivers of unstagnant water” (47:15) and “a gushing fountain” (88:11-12). One religious water ritual that draws all these elements of life, purification, protection, healing, separation, and redemption together is the Roman Catholic sacrament of Baptism. The word sacrament comes from the Latin word sacramentum , which means ""a sign of the sacred"". The Roman Catholic sacrament Baptism 1 1. By Melchior2006 (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons Source: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ABaptism.JPG In the sacrament of Baptism, Christians have water poured over them or immerse themselves in water to be cleansed of sin and admitted into the Christian community. In the Roman Catholic ritual, the community prays, “In Baptism we use the gift of water, which you have made a rich symbol of the grace you give us in this sacrament. At the very dawn of creation, your Spirit breathed on the waters, making them the wellspring of all holiness. The waters of the great flood you made a sign of the waters of Baptism that made an end of sin and a new beginning of goodness.” Here, again, water is a medium for communicating the sacrality of life and situating the inevitable cycle of that life within an ancient story of separation and redemption. Questions to Consider Imagine you are visiting the Maasai people of East Africa and you are invited to observe their traditional rainmaking ritual. Watch it here . What does this ritual tell you about the relationship of the Maasai people to water? Do you find a ritual like this meaningful? If so, why? If not, why not? Water in Spiritual Life Human beings need a change of heart to fully respect the sacred gift of water. 1 1. CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Source: ""http://pixabay.com/en/water-water-level-hands-palms-boy-332670/ "" While water has been vital for religious symbolism and ritual throughout human history, too many members of the world’s religions neglect to respect water as a finite natural resource. Many members of religious communities and likewise many people who profess no religion, are in need of an inner, spiritual conversion to appreciate the value of water. The necessity of this conversion The act or process of significantly changing from one state of mind, emotion, and behavior to another. , or “change of heart”, is central to the message of the Jesuit [Society of Jesus]: An order of regular clergy in the Roman Catholic Church, founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, that is strongly committed to education, theological scholarship, and missionary work. Members are called Jesuits. document Healing a Broken World, the document that provides the spiritual basis for this Healing Earth textbook. Healing a Broken World challenges us by saying we are “in need of a change of heart [conversion]: The act or process of significantly changing from one state of mind, emotion, and behavior to another. . Click here to read Healing a Broken World . We need to confront our inner resistances and cast a grateful look on creation, letting our heart be touched by its wounded reality and making a strong personal and communal commitment to healing it.” We can see three emphases in this statement: gratitude for creation, reconciliation with wounded creation, and action that heals creation. In the Christian religious tradition, a true change of heart toward the natural world manifests a deep inner feeling of gratitude to God for the gift of creation, a gift God saw as “very good” (Genesis 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25). With belief in the fundamental goodness of all creation, Saint Ignatius Loyola [St. Ignatius Loyola]: A saint of the Roman Catholic Church and founder of the religious order of men known as the Society of Jesus (1491-1556). encouraged Christians to “find God in all things”. No less so with water. It is a gift of God and a place to find God. Yet, Christians have abused God’s gift of creation. This not only wounds creation and insults God, but also harms people, as we all depend on the fruits of creation for our own survival. A true spirituality of gratitude prompts the courage needed to reconcile with the wounded. Healing a Broken World says we have the “urgent task of reconciliation with creation”, which is also linked to a reconciliation with the poor, the people whose lives are most affected by the water crisis. A true spirituality of gratitude for the natural world must include a recognition that we have abused creation and are in need of the courage to reconcile with God, others, and creation. In the Christian religious tradition, true reconciliation flows out of a restoration of one’s relationship with God with gratitude for the gift of creation. This reconciliation provides the spiritual energy to imagine a healed Earth and act in ways to make real what we imagine. You will recall from the Healing Earth Introduction, that Ignatian Pedagogy A way of learning and a method of teaching developed by the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus that emphasizes learning through a sequence of 'seeing', 'judging', reflecting', and 'acting'. moves us through a process of seeing scientifically, evaluating ethically, reflecting spiritually, and acting effectively. This process has been creatively communicated in this video by Tomasz ?migla, a student at Kostka Jesuit Secondary School in Krakow, Poland. It is to this fourth ‘water and action’ step that we now turn. Questions to Consider Imagine that you are in a conversation with St. Ignatius Loyola and he invites you to “see God in all things”. What do you think he means by this? Read this brief discussion for more information. If you truly followed his advice, what difference do you think this would make in how you use water? What difference do you think it would make in your attitude toward the natural world? ‹ Water and Ethics up Water and Action › PDF version View? site:?

7," Music and Spirituality - Sri Chinmoy SriChinmoy.org en Sri Chinmoy Spirituality Service Resources Kind Words Home » Resources » Library » Music and Spirituality » Music and Spirituality Resources Library Selected Links Music Recordings Music and Spirituality Plays Sports Sri Chinmoy Answers Stories Talks Topics Videos Original Selected Links Music and Spirituality His soulful music expressed His aspiration, His realisation And his oneness With the Universal Consciousness. God’s favourite sound Is the sound of His inner Music. This inner Music Is the music of earth’s transformation And humanity’s life-perfection. It is quite possible to be both a musician and a Yogi. In Mother India there have been many saints, sages and spiritual Masters who were blessed with divine music. Their musical talent did not interfere with their God-realisation, and even after achieving God-realisation, their musical talents did not leave them. Yoga means union, inseparable oneness with God. A Yogi is one who has established conscious union with God. He can easily become a musician because in his inseparable oneness with God, he can do anything he wants. But a Yogi has to wait for God’s Will. If it is God’s Will, he will become a musician; or if it is God’s Will, he will become something else. Otherwise, he will just remain with his own lofty realisation and oneness; he will reveal and manifest the highest Peace, Light and Truth the way the Supreme wants him to. When an individual realises God, he and God are not different beings; they are one, like a tiny drop and the vast ocean. In the same way, sometimes the soul responds to music. The soul thrills to music; it just melts and becomes one. A Yogi’s qualities and a musician’s qualities can go side by side, provided the Yogi has the capacity and inherent talent for music. Even if the Yogi spends a very short time in the musical world, he can be a very good musician, but it will take infinitely more time for a musician to become a Yogi. Spiritual Masters who have musical capacity can eventually show the world at large that inner music can be played outwardly and appreciated by the world. Inner music one can hear and one can create while one is meditating. We can hear inner music through aspiration. What is inner music? We have learned from the Indian Vedas that this music is the mother tongue of humanity, the language of the soul. It is through music that the Divine in us gets the opportunity to manifest itself here on earth. When a musician’s spiritual capacity becomes most powerful, he doesn’t even have to speak. Others will just look at his face and see some illumination. When a spiritual Master plays his music, through his music he enters into the heart and soul of the audience. At the same time, he is bringing down light from above. He is not just playing on an instrument. He is receiving something from the higher world and then offering it to the world at large. In an hour, thousands of people can feel this higher light as their very own. So music has the opportunity, the capacity, to claim the universe as its very own. Music and religion are like the obverse and reverse of the same reality-coin. Music in its purest sense is religion and religion in its purest sense is music. This music-religion, this code of life, this universal language of the soul, can only be offered; it cannot be purchased or sold. Music and religion are for the seekers, for the music-lovers, for the truth-servers. Money-power or earthly name and fame cannot lord it over these two immortal realities, these two earthly and heavenly treasures. The source of true music and the source of true religion will always remain the same, and that source is a cry, a birthless and deathless cry — an eternal hunger. It is a hunger not for one’s own satisfaction, but for God’s Satisfaction in God’s own way. When music and religion come from this source, only then will the message and beauty of music and the message and beauty of religion be divinely illumining and fulfilling. The Mogul Emperor Akbar employed the great musician Tansen in his court. One day when Akbar was deeply appreciating Tansen, Tansen said, “I am not a great musician.” Akbar said, “You are not only a great musician; you are the best musician.” But Tansen said, “No, my Guru, my teacher, Haridas, is by far the best.” The Emperor said, “Then bring him to my palace!” Tansen replied, “No, he will not come. He does not care for name and fame. He plays only for God. God’s Compassion is his sole reward.” Akbar said, “Then I will have to go to him. Take me to him.” Tansen agreed, but he told Akbar, “You cannot go as the Emperor. You have to go in the guise of my servant, my slave.” So Akbar went to Tansen’s teacher as a servant, and Tansen begged his teacher to play for Akbar. Unfortunately, Haridas was not in the mood to play. Then a brilliant idea struck Tansen’s mind. He started playing, deliberately making many mistakes. Haridas could not believe his eyes and ears. How could his best student make such deplorable mistakes? Out of great surprise and shock, he started playing in order to correct his student. In this way the Emperor came to realise that Tansen’s teacher was indeed far superior to Tansen. When they came back to the palace, Akbar asked Tansen, “How is it that you cannot play as soulfully as your teacher does?” Tansen replied, “I play for name and fame. I play for you. He plays for God. Here is the difference. If I played for God—for God in you, for God in everyone—only then would my music be supernatural, heavenly, supremely soulful and perfect. But I play for money-power, for name and fame. How do you expect me to play the way my teacher does?” Can spiritual music inspire non-spiritual listeners? Spiritual music can inspire non-spiritual listeners in the same way that God inspires unaspiring humanity. In the beginning there was darkness; then there was light. Because God has always inspired unaspiring humanity, this light is continually increasing. If some individuals are not aspiring right now, it is the bounden duty of those who are already awakened to inspire them in the same way that the Supreme, out of His infinite bounty, inspired and continues to inspire the ones who are now well established in the world of aspiration. Each individual has a heart. Spirituality is in the heart, with the heart and for the heart. It is only a matter of time before the heart responds to spiritual music, which embodies the beauty and purity of music in its pristine form and in infinite measure. A great musician can add to the inner cry of the person who practises a spiritual life. And if the musician himself believes in God wholeheartedly, then his music can be of tremendous help to his own spiritual practice. What do you concentrate on when you play music? Most of the time I concentrate on the soul of the particular piece that I am playing. Each song has a soul, so I concentrate on the soul of each song. Sometimes I concentrate on the soul of a particular melody that I feel is very haunting; and I try to reveal and manifest the divine beauty of that melody. You have created thousands of paintings, poems and songs. Where does this endless fountain of creativity come from? This endless fountain of creativity comes from only one Source, and that Source I call the unconditional Compassion of my Lord Beloved Supreme. He bestows upon me His unconditional Compassion-Light and according to my receptivity He creates in and through me. Is there art in other worlds besides earth? Yes, there is art in other worlds and other planes of consciousness apart from earth, but this art is not for manifestation. This art is something that exists for its own sake. It comes spontaneously. Here on earth, whenever we do something, even if we just exist, we do it for the sake of others. A tree has flowers and fruits. Even if the tree doesn’t want to give me anything, still I can climb up its trunk and eat its fruits or pluck its flowers, or I can just enjoy its shade if I want to. But in the other worlds it is not like that. There you can appreciate the beauty of something, but you can’t claim it or use it for your own purpose. Here on earth, as soon as art is created, you can steal it with force or buy it or plead with the artist to give it to you. In the other worlds, you can at most appreciate it, but you can’t capture the art, you can’t claim it, you can’t acquire it, because it is not manifested. In other worlds you see the Gandharvas—the celestial musicians like Narada, who is the most prominent one. There is a particular world where a constant assembly of musicians is held. There is also a world for artists in the inner world. There are some artists who have not taken incarnation but just remain in this inner world. Again, some great artists, spiritual artists from earth, go to this world to enjoy it when they leave the body. O Master-Musician, Tune me for life again. The awakening of new music My heart wants to become. My life is now mingled In ecstasy’s height. ?

Religion and Science Religion and Science complimentary not contradictory Research By applying scientific method to the study of consciousness, Brahmavarchas Research Center is dedicated to the union of science and spirituality. At a superficial level, the two streams of knowledge, Science and Spirituality, both aimed at finding the ultimate truth, appear to be contradicting and nullifying each others principles. Science, developed on perceivable evidence-driven reasoning and logic, advocated that the attainment of truth is possible only with the help of material based scientific investigations and developments. Spirituality recognizes that the means of attainment of this truth lies within in the form of immortal soul, which is the Conscious Self. In other words spirituality is the science of consciousness, involving mind, body and spirit relationship. A subject of divine faith and devotion, initially, it leads to realization of ultimate unity of all beings. If the true meaning of science is understood – as search of truth beyond any barriers of matter and visible world, there would be no difficulty in accepting the fact that spirituality also falls in its periphery which pertains to sublime domains of realizations.... This attitude widens the scope of knowledge and search of ultimate truth through perfect integration of modern sciences and the ancient science of spirituality and religion. Mouth is described in the Âyurveda as the locus of the agni cakra – the subtle centre for the generation of metabolic powers and thermal energy. The group of energies required for various metabolic and physiological processing is described to have its field of action beginning from the mouth and spreading up to the stomach. The mechanical role of mouth and its energy (utilized in the process of chewing and gulping, for instance) in the digestive system is well known. More important is its role as linked with the vocal cord and hence with the functions of speaking and singing.... The power of speech is among the most significant gifts bestowed upon the human species. Its importance can be very well understood simply by realizing the limitations and disabilities of a dumb fellow. At the gross level, the agni cakra of mouth performs the initial phase of digestive mechanism, at the subtle level, it ‘produces’ voice and helps pronunciation. At the astral level it generates divine flows of the ‘currents’ of Ïabda in the individual consciousness. While the first two are well known to most of us, the third and the most significant role is experienced only by the experts of the japa yoga – the spiritual endeavors associated with japa and meditation of mantras. The inlet of mouth is also regarded a living havan kuñda with respect to the divine importance of the sonic energy as a source of expression of multiple manifestations of Ïabda. One would be surprised to note that the enormous impact of japa yoga is based on this sublime power of his mouth. That words spoken could well become the cause of an affectionate relationship or of hatred and hosility – illustrates the fact that the words are not only the carriers of information but they do retain and convey the sentiments of the speaker. The currents of consciousness of the speaker endowed in his speech flow with the sonic vibrations produced by the pronunciation of these words. These elements produce ‘conscious–effects’ at the destination with which the associated sound waves collide. While the acoustic effects could be studied by physical means, the ‘conscious-effects’, being latent and subliminal in nature, can only be realized and analyzed through spiritual practices of yoga sadhanas. Extraction of the essence of the conscious power of the words (sound) is aimed at in the japa yoga. The physical vibrations generated by the sound of rhythmic enunciation (japa) affect the body of the chanter (sadhaka) and his surrounding space and the associated conscious elements induce his mind and the inner self and ‘titillate’ the related conscious-energy centers in the cosmic domains. The science of mantras is founded on the science of the ‘conscious currents’ of the Ïabda inherent in the musical sound generated by a conscious being. The meaning of the mantras has negligible importance as compared to the specific configuration of syllables/phonemes in them. The Gayatri Mantra is regarded as supreme of all the Vaidika Mantras. In terms of linguistic meaning, it is a universal prayer of arousal and illumination of righteous intellect in all.Many other divine prayers written in different languages might also imply similar meanings, but it is the unique sonic pattern that gives a unique importance to this mantra. The subtle sonic pattern of this mantra is supposed to generate specific vibrations in the gross as well as the mental and causal bodies of the sadhaka and in his surroundings. These vibrations empowered by the spiritual force of the sadhaka’s purified inner self conjugate with the extrasensory impulse of the supreme consciousness…. The single lettered (bija) mantras like Hrim, Klim, Ai,Hum, Yam, Fat etc. are of basic importance in the science of mantras because of the special conscious as well as ‘mechanical’ (tantrika) effects of their sounds. The cyclic enunciation (or chanting) under different rhythms, pitches and intensities is practiced in the japa of a mantra to make different uses of its (mantra’s) sonic vibrations. In M³nasika Japa the mantra is uttered silently (mentally); the level of ‘perceivable’ sound increases gradually (e.g. from the silent movements of the lips and the tongue to murmuring and humming) in the upansu and vacika japas. As described in the previous sections, the Vaidika Mantras also have specific swaras (classical musical accents) associated with them that offer varieties in their japa and hence in their effects..... The Sama Gana (vaidika modes of collective chanting) of these mantras indeed creates powerful currents with latent but inducing impacts at the physical and the subtle levels of matter and consciousness. The consistent japa of the mantras has dual effects: externally, it generates vibrations in the surrounding space and internally, it stimulates the extrasensory energy centers (cakras) and subtle endocrine glands inside the body. The impact of these effects amplifies significantly with continuous repetition of such rhythmic enunciation at a constant pace. Laboratory experiments have shown the physical strength of rhythmic sound that can empower a small cork to push a heavy iron rod..... A large number of examples of the Doppler effect given in the earlier sections should suffice to evince the physical potential of the superimposed sound waves. The internal creative effects of japa can be illustrated by simple analogy with the functioning of a typewriter. When a key of a typewriter is pressed, its impact results in the printing of the corresponding letter or symbol on the paper. Similarly, the vibrations produced by silent or vocal enunciation of a syllable or combinations of the syllables of a mantra make specific impressions on the subtle energy centers and nerve-bundles and stimulate them. Regular repeated practice of the same japa under adept disciplines is indeed the root of the enormous potential gained during different spiritual experiments of Mantra-Vijana. That friction gives rise to the thermal and electrical (static) energies – is well known to every student of physics. The internal vibrations produced by the sonic waves of japa create similar effects and activate the otherwise unused latent glands and extrasensory energy centers inside the body of the sadhaka. The advanced scientific applications ranging –– from remote control of the space-crafts by electromagnetic waves; delicate surgeries to heavy metal cutting by the Lasers.... etc clearly illustrate that it is not the equipment or the device but it is the ‘power’ of the (energy) waves that induces such wonderful effects. The supernatural effects of the suprasonic waves generated by the japa of mantras are more remarkable and are still beyond the reach of the advanced instruments (generators and the sensory devices) developed so far. In terms of the modern (material based) science or acoustics, sound is generated by vibrations produced in any physical medium. The modern psychologists have gone one step ahead by accepting the latent power of voice that affects the minds of the speaker and the listeners.... (e.g. the effects of harsh or affectionate voices of same frequencies and intensities are drastically different....). These are only the crude and restricted manifestations of the power of Ïabda. The dimensions of Ïabda expand far beyond the physical, psychological and inner sentimental levels....They include the sublime realms of consciousness and therefore form a subject of investigations by the spiritual scientists. The japa yoga aims at using the physical as well as the spiritual power of Ïabda with the help of the specific sonic patterns of the mantras. The subtle energy waves generated by the japa of a mantra reach at the specific cosmic center (linked with the devata of the mantra) and attract the supernatural currents of cosmic consciousness in proportionate amounts. The whole universe is like an ocean of the electromagnetic and conscious energy waves. The flow of thoughts and sentiments takes place via the latter kind of omnipresent waves. The sublime energy waves produced along with the ‘physical’ sound waves by the japa are spread in the cosmos and they reach back (with an amplified impact) to the sadhaka after being superimposed and further ‘electrified’ by the subtle waves of similar nature existing along theircosmic path.... The divine or the evil thoughts generated by an individual mind influence the fields of thoughts in the surrounding by attracting the thought waves of compatible quality and repulsing those of the opposite quality. The thought waves form their own field of attraction that adds to the expansion of the corresponding (divine or evil) currents of thoughts in the cosmic domains as well. Similar is the effect of the waves of consciousness generated by different kinds of sentiments and emotions. The waves of thoughts or sentiments/emotions of an individual are strengthened in the similar (matching) fields traversed by them during their cosmic journey. And, because of the periodic nature of the movement of waves, they eventually reach back their origin. Completion of each such cycle amplifies the intensity of the associated good or bad effects. These inducing effects, though subliminal in nature, indeed play an important role in inspiring and shaping one’s character and hence in building one’s destiny too. The subtle waves generated by the mantra-japa are often more powerful and faster than the thought waves of the sadhaka. If generated repeatedly, in a consistent cyclic manner, these suprasonic waves help create serene and divine ambience within and around the sadhaka with strong field of attraction to influence the other waves of thoughts and sentiments that might collide with them. It is well known that the compounded magnetic effects of similar atoms (particles) gives rise to their dense collection. This clustering eventually results in the formation a mine, which gets richer by the augmentation in its power of attraction by successive increase in its repository of similar atoms (particles). Equivalently, the domain of influence of the subtle sonic waves generated by the japa of a mantra expands and becomes more powerful with the increase in the number of persons of similar spiritual levels who perform collective japa.The amplification of the radio waves by powerful transmitters at the relay centers makes their broadcast possible across the globe. Analogously, the force of the conscious energy in the waves generated by the japa intensifies along with the increase in the faith, sincerity, strength and piety of thoughts and sentiments of the sadhaka(s).

If it were just matter, there would be no need for comfort. Matter does not feel comfort or discomfort, beauty or ugliness, love or compassion, joy or sorrow. Will a chair ever feel sorry or happy? No, matter does not have these finer values. They belong to the realm of the spirit. But life is also more than spirit. If it were just spirit, there would be no need for water, food, or rest. Human life is a combination of both matter and spirit. The nature of the spirit Spirit experiences and expresses values. Values are feelings and emotions -- that which cannot be captured totally by words or understood by the intellect. The goal of the spiritual path is to understand the spiritual dimension of life and live fully all the values that the spirit represents. What are those values? Peace, love, joy, beauty, unlimited knowledge, and the capacity to understand both mind and matter. Comfort: A quality of consciousness Whatever one does is directed towards one goal, happiness or comfort. Often people think that comfort comes in a material way, through matter alone. Comfort is a quality of consciousness. To some degree it does depend on matter, but to a greater degree it depends on attitude and understanding. The true nature of the spirit is comprehension You listen, you understand and you absorb. Who is understanding? Who is absorbing? It is the spirit in your body that is taking in the knowledge. And this knowledge is not coming through sight, sound, smell, taste and touch alone. It is also coming from inside as intuition. The very nature of consciousness is knowledge You can say that at every level of consciousness, knowledge is present. And consciousness is present! If it were nothing, it could not be present. It is something, yet it is not finite. You cannot measure consciousness, so it is present and infinite. The nature of your consciousness is peace: You are love Consciousness is peace. You are peace, you are truth, and you are energy, walking, moving, talking, sitting. The ""self"" is energy and the ""self"" is knowledge, the knowing and the knower. This consciousness is love, you are love. Understanding and living this is the spiritual life. Life attains its richest form through the spiritual dimension. Without it life becomes very shallow and you are unhappy, dependent, depressed and miserable. The effects of the spiritual dimension on society This is a great sense of belongingness, responsibility, compassion and caring for the whole of humanity. The spiritual dimension, in its true form, breaks the narrow boundaries of caste, creed, religion and nationality. Wars will be eliminated only through spiritual understanding. The spiritual path is not an escape from life Actually, the spiritual path makes life more difficult! In India people think the spiritual life is easy -- go to an ashram where you don't have to work hard. No! The spiritual path is not an escape from hard work or sincere action, just as social service is not an escape to a comfortable life. In both situations you have to put your heart and soul into your actions and be ready to give a hundred percent of yourself. The spiritual life will bring you enormous joy, more contentment, more peace and more energy than you can find, but it's not an escape. The spiritual path is not an escape from responsibility The spiritual path means taking responsibility. If you think it is difficult to manage your children and your spouse, you will be given more people to care for. If you are ready to take responsibility for 20 people, 2,000 people, 20 million people, then you are on the path. The spiritual path is not an escape from responsibility, but taking responsibility. The spiritual path is not an escape from hard work Intelligent, effective work is part of the spiritual life. When you are working hard you may think you deserve compassion. I say that if you are working hard and doing it with intelligence, then you need appreciation, not compassion. If someone is taking five hours to complete something that can be done in half an hour, it doesn't need compassion. Knowing peace Another aspect of spiritual life is peace -- knowing that peace is your nature. At any moment, in any place, you can just sit and let go, knowing that inside you there is a pure clear space that's vast and deep. That inner space is what you are. Feeling this is knowing your spiritual dimension. ''I have come from peace, I am in peace, I will go back to peace. Peace is my origin and my goal.'' This inner affirmation or experience makes you a seeker. A sense of sacredness Still another aspect of spiritual life is a sense of sacredness. When you have a deep sense of thankfulness combined with regard and respect for everything that comes to you in life, it brings a sense of sacredness. In sacredness there is awareness. Your mind is fully present in fear, anger or sacredness. Service and silence Silence heals and rejuvenates. Silence gives you depth and stability and brings creativity. Service brings the dynamic experience of heart. It creates a sense of belongingness. Lack of service can land a person in depression. Service alone can bring contentment in life, but service without silence tires you. Service without spirituality will be shallow and cannot be sustained for a long period of time. The deeper the silence, the more dynamic the outer activity becomes. Both are essential in life. Have confidence Have confidence in yourself. One who does not have confidence cannot achieve anything. Confidence clears doubt. Doubt is the opposite of confidence. Once you eliminate the negative, you will see that the positive has already happened. When doubt clears, confidence appears. So to gain confidence in yourself, you must understand what doubt is. The nature of doubt If you observe the nature of doubt, it is always about something that is positive. You doubt the goodness of other people, never their bad qualities. You doubt your own capabilities, never your incapabilities. On the spiritual path, you learn to handle things with intuition and inner freedom. I don't say don't doubt. I say doubt as much as you can. That will help you get through it before progressing further.

Spiritual Wellness is a personal matter involving values and beliefs that provide a purpose in our lives. While different individuals may have different views of what spiritualism is, it is generally considered to be the search for meaning and purpose in human existence, leading one to strive for a state of harmony with oneself and others while working to balance inner needs with the rest of the world. The National Wellness Institute says spiritual wellness follows the following tenets: It is better to ponder the meaning of life for ourselves and to be tolerant of the beliefs of others than to close our minds and become intolerant. It is better to live each day in a way that is consistent with our values and beliefs than to do otherwise and feel untrue to ourselves. Reaching Spiritual Wellness It is important for everyone to explore what they believe is their own sense of meaning and purpose. The path to spiritual wellness may involve meditation, prayer, affirmations, or specific spiritual practices that support your connection to a higher power or belief system. Yoga and meditation can also help you develop spiritual wellness. Having compassion, the capacity for love and forgiveness, altruism, joy, and fulfillment help you enjoy your spiritual health. Your religious faith, values, beliefs, principles, and morals define your spirituality. If you are a person engaged in the process of spiritual wellness, you are willing and able to transcend yourself in order to question the meaning and purpose in your life and the lives of others. In addition, you seek to find harmony between that which lies within and the social and physical forces that come from outside. Are you engaged in the process of spiritual wellness? Evaluate your own spiritual wellness with this brief quiz. Do I make time for relaxation in my day? Do I make time for meditation and/or prayer? Do my values guide my decisions and actions? Am I accepting of the views of others? If you answered ""No"" to any of the questions, it may indicate an area where you need to improve the state of your spiritual wellness.

For some, it's about participating in organized religion : going to a church, synagogue, mosque, and so on. For others, it's more personal—some people get in touch with their spiritual side through private prayer, yoga, meditation , quiet reflection, or even long walks. Research shows that even skeptics can't stifle the sense that there is something greater than the concrete world we see. As the brain processes sensory experiences, we naturally look for patterns and then seek out meaning in those patterns. And the phenomenon known as "" cognitive dissonance "" shows that once we believe in something, we will try to explain away anything that conflicts with it. Humans can't help but ask big questions—the instinct seems wired in our minds. Invisible Forces Does Being Religious Make Us Happy? Cutting-edge science on happiness and religiosity By Todd B.

We all speculate about the meaning of all kinds of things, from everyday concerns about dealing with a co-worker to our ultimate beliefs about the purpose of existence. Accompanying solutions we find to these problems, there’s a range of satisfied feelings, from “ah-ha” or light-bulb moments upon solving an everyday problem to ecstatic feelings during mystical experiences. Since everyday and spiritual concerns are variations of the same thinking processes, Newberg thinks it’s essential to examine how people experience spirituality in order to fully understand how their brains work. Looking at the bigger questions has already provided practical applications for improving mental and physical health. When practitioners surrender their will, activity decreases in their frontal lobes, suggesting that speech is being generated from some place other than the normal speech centers. Newberg is a pioneer in the field of neurotheology, the neurological study of religious and spiritual experiences. In the 1990s, he began his work in the field by scanning what happens in people’s brains when they meditate, because it is a spiritual practice that is relatively easy to monitor. Since then, he’s looked at around 150 brain scans, including those of Buddhists, nuns, atheists, Pentecostals speaking in tongues, and Brazilian mediums practicing psychography—the channeling of messages from the dead through handwriting. As to what’s going on in their brains, Newberg says, “It depends to some degree on what the practice is.” Practices that involve concentrating on something over and over again, either through prayer or a mantra-based meditation, tend to activate the frontal lobes, the areas chiefly responsible for directing attention, modulating behavior, and expressing language. Dr. Andrew Newberg/The Atlantic In contrast, when practitioners surrender their will, such as when they speak in tongues or function as a medium, activity decreases in their frontal lobes and increases in their thalamus, the tiny brain structure that regulates the flow of incoming sensory information to many parts of the brain. This suggests that their speech is being generated from some place other than the normal speech centers. Dr. Andrew Newberg/The Atlantic Believers could say this proves that another entity is speaking through the practitioner, while nonbelievers would look for a neurological explanation. Newberg takes into account both perspectives. When he defines neurotheology in his book, Principles of Neurotheology , he writes, “An ardent atheist, who refuses to accept any aspect of religion as possibly correct or useful, or a devout religious person, who refuses to accept science as providing any value regarding knowledge of the world, would most likely not be considered a neurotheologian.” Newberg believes everyone can benefit from some type of meditation practice. If one practice isn’t working for an individual, she should try something else. As a general rule, these practices lower depression, anxiety, and stress. He adds that at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, where he is director of research at the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine, researchers have found that meditation can improve memory and concentration. It’s debatable whether these practices are more effective when founded on religious or spiritual beliefs. Dr. Dean Hamer, author of the book, The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes , discovered that research subjects with a particular variation of a certain gene were more susceptible to self-transcendent, spiritual experiences. A meditator may experience a sense of oneness with all living things because of reduced activity in the parietal lobes, which results in a blurring of the perceived lines between the meditator and other objects. In a lecture given at Marlboro College titled, “ Gays, God, and Genes ,” Hamer compares the effects of this variation to an enhanced capacity for natural highs. This spiritual tendency also depends on a person’s environment, according to Hamer, which can direct their innate spirituality to particular religious beliefs, and/or steer them away from religion altogether. He says that science will never replace spirituality because a reliance on facts will never have the same emotional appeal. Newberg agrees that spiritual beliefs are influenced by a person’s genetics and environment, and that meditation practices are more effective when they reinforce a practitioner’s belief system. However, he says researchers are still investigating whether religious beliefs in general make healthier and happier people. He considers atheism to be a belief system as well, and says that a possible a mental health benefit of belonging to a religious denomination could be not just belief, but the built-in social network. If the euphoria a person experiences during a meditation practice can’t be integrated into their preexisting belief system, these feelings may become disturbing. Newberg gave as an example a meditator who sought out a clergy member to talk about his practice and felt a bit brushed off by the cleric. When meditation practices enhance a rigid, authoritarian belief system, Newberg said they can lead to more intolerance and violence towards those of different beliefs. In the book he co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman, Why We Believe What We Believe , he writes that due to some overlap between spiritual beliefs and psychological disorders, patients with obsessive compulsive disorders often develop rigid religious beliefs. Newberg had always wanted to be a medical doctor, but didn’t realize he could combine that with his interest in searching for answers to metaphysical questions until he attended medical school at the University of Pennsylvania and worked with Dr. Eugene d'Aquili, a psychiatrist whose research focused on religion. Newberg has studied Eastern and Western thinkers to understand their differing perspectives on whether or not an objective reality exists outside of human perception. What fascinates him about mystical experiences—the goal of many meditation practices—are the reports of experiencing a higher reality that is “more real” than everyday perceptions. Related Story Religion as a Product of Psychotropic Drug Use Newberg said it’s “the only description that I’ve ever seen where somebody will say ‘I got beyond my brain, I got beyond my ego self, I got beyond the subjective and objective nature of the world;’ and then they see the universe, and they experience the universe in a very, very different kind of way.” He added, “I think these experiences need to be taken very seriously. I think they tell us something about the nature of reality and how we perceive that reality.” When Newberg scanned the brains of nuns and Buddhists undergoing mystical experiences, they reported feelings of timelessness, spacelessness, and self-transcendence. Newberg believes a cause of these feelings is the reduced activity he saw in their parietal lobes, the orientation area of the brain responsible for perceiving three-dimensional objects in space. A meditator may experience a sense of oneness with all living things or unity because the reduced activity blurs the perceived lines between the meditator and other objects. When the parietal lobes are damaged, patients have distorted beliefs about their own bodies and are sometimes confused about their spatial orientation to outside objects. In an example from Why We Believe What We Believe , patients think one of their own legs is not theirs, and have been found trying to throw this other leg out of their bed. In his new book, Newberg cites a study led by Dr. Brick Johnstone that found that damage to the right parietal lobe caused patients’ self-transcendent experiences to increase. Newberg suggests in his new book that mystical experiences are described as blissful or ecstatic because they share many of the same neural pathways in the parietal and frontal lobes that are involved in sexual arousal. To take his scans, Newburg uses functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging. The book Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience , lists their technological limitations. The authors, Drs. Sally Satel and Scott Lilienfeld, write that one limitation of brain imaging is that researchers can’t make a neat map of the brain centers for different activities like phrenologists once did. Even if most people process language expression in one particular area, this processing is highly dependent on connections to other brain activities. The brain is also plastic, so if the usual area for speech is damaged, other areas in the brain may reorganize and take over the function. While locating the appropriate brain centers, researchers must also break down the steps involved in a seemingly unified mental task. The authors provide a simple arithmetic problem as an example. Researchers must consider that one section of the brain enables a person to visually recognize the numbers, another section registers the magnitude of the numbers, and a third section computes the sum. If neuroscientists are trying to understand attitudes or emotions, they have to take into account more complicated steps. Furthermore, the technology isn’t advanced enough to pick up all the rapid neural changes that occur during a mental process. A challenge has been figuring out precisely what interviewees mean when they use concepts like God or spirituality. Everyone defines God differently, even when they belong to the same religion. When e-mailed to comment specifically on Newberg’s work, Satel responded that today’s imaging is enabling researchers to make clinical inroads into dementia and other major mental illnesses, but she’s skeptical that knowing a person’s neurochemical and other physical processes will ever provide a detailed understanding of someone’s subjective beliefs. Even with advances in technology, “we can’t predict the real world contexts in which perceptions, cognitions, or emotion will manifest. The interaction of these dimensions with environment is crucial to understanding behavioral outcomes.” Asked about the technological challenges, Newberg said that “it’s not easy doing this research.” However, “up until the last 20 years, we’ve never been able to see anything. So it’s certainly a vast improvement over nothing, but it’s still not nearly as ideal as what we would like.” Supplementing the scans, Newberg and his team interview meditators about their subjective experiences in order to get a better understanding of what is happening to them physically. For this method, a challenge has been figuring out precisely what interviewees mean when they use concepts like God or spirituality. Newberg has found that everyone defines God a little bit differently even when they belong to the same religion. When describing spiritual experiences, some report that these experiences enhance their religious beliefs, and others turn away from religion and engage in individual practices. Given the challenges of the technology and the multitude of beliefs and practices, I asked Newberg if he ever gets overwhelmed. ""It's a little overwhelming. You sort of take one thing at a time and just proceed slowly, and I try very hard not to get too far ahead of myself or too ahead of the data,"" he said. ""But I guess it's somewhat of a calling for me. I've always felt like I've got to go down this path, and I'll keep going down it, and maybe someday I'll figure something out that will really be helpful to everybody.""

As we go about our daily lives, we tend to assume that our perceptions—sights, sounds, textures, tastes—are an accurate portrayal of the real world. Sure, when we stop and think about it—or when we find ourselves fooled by a perceptual illusion—we realize with a jolt that what we perceive is never the world directly, but rather our brain’s best guess at what that world is like, a kind of internal simulation of an external reality. Still, we bank on the fact that our simulation is a reasonably decent one. If it wasn’t, wouldn’t evolution have weeded us out by now? The true reality might be forever beyond our reach, but surely our senses give us at least an inkling of what it’s really like. Continue Reading Tyrone Siu / Reuters So, Why Can't You Call Taiwan? David A. Graham President-elect Donald Trump has committed a sharp breach of protocol—one that underscores just how weird some important protocols are. Updated on December 2 at 7:49 p.m. It’s hardly remembered now, having been overshadowed a few months later on September 11, but the George W. Bush administration’s first foreign-policy crisis came in the South China Sea. On April 1, 2001, a U.S. Navy surveillance plane collided with a Chinese jet near Hainan Island. The pilot of the Chinese jet was killed, and the American plane was forced to land and its crew was held hostage for 11 days, until a diplomatic agreement was worked out. Sino-American relations remained tense for some time. Unlike Bush, Donald Trump didn’t need to wait to be inaugurated to set off a crisis in the relationship. He managed that on Friday, with a phone call to the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen. It’s a sharp breach with protocol, but it’s also just the sort that underscores how weird and incomprehensible some important protocols are. Continue Reading Marc Burckhardt The Unbelievable Tale of Jesus’s Wife Ariel Sabar A hotly contested, supposedly ancient manuscript suggests Christ was married. But believing its origin story—a real-life Da Vinci Code , involving a Harvard professor, a onetime Florida pornographer, and an escape from East Germany—requires a big leap of faith. On a humid afternoon this past November, I pulled off Interstate 75 into a stretch of Florida pine forest tangled with runaway vines. My GPS was homing in on the house of a man I thought might hold the master key to one of the strangest scholarly mysteries in recent decades: a 1,300-year-old scrap of papyrus that bore the phrase “Jesus said to them, My wife.” The fragment, written in the ancient language of Coptic, had set off shock waves when an eminent Harvard historian of early Christianity, Karen L. King, presented it in September 2012 at a conference in Rome. Never before had an ancient manuscript alluded to Jesus’s being married. The papyrus’s lines were incomplete, but they seemed to describe a dialogue between Jesus and the apostles over whether his “wife”—possibly Mary Magdalene—was “worthy” of discipleship. Its main point, King argued, was that “women who are wives and mothers can be Jesus’s disciples.” She thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether “marriage or celibacy [was] the ideal mode of Christian life” and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy. Continue Reading Comedy Central Trevor Noah Finds His Late-Night Voice David Sims The Daily Show host was measured, respectful, and challenging in his 26-minute conversation with TheBlaze pundit Tomi Lahren. Tomi Lahren, the 24-year-old host of Tomi on the conservative cable network TheBlaze, feels like a pundit created by a computer algorithm, someone who primarily exists to say something provocative enough to jump to the top of a Facebook feed. She’s called the Black Lives Matter movement “ the new KKK ,” partly blamed the 2015 Chattanooga shootings on President Obama’s “ Muslim sensitivity ,” and declared Colin Kaepernick a “whiny, indulgent, attention-seeking cry-baby.” At a time when such charged political rhetoric feels increasingly like the norm, Lahren stands at one end of a widening gulf—which made her appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Wednesday night all the more fascinating. In his first year at The Daily Show , Noah has struggled to distinguish himself in an outrage-driven late-night universe. He has sometimes seemed too flip about the failures of the country’s news media, something his predecessor Jon Stewart made a perennial target. Noah’s 26-minute conversation with Lahren, though, posted in its entirety online , set the kind of tone that Stewart frequently called for throughout his tenure. The segment never turned into a screaming match, but it also avoided platitudes and small-talk. Lahren was unapologetic about her online bombast and leaned into arguments that drew gasps and boos from Noah’s audience, but the host remained steadfastly evenhanded throughout. If Noah was looking for a specific episode that would help him break out in his crowded field, he may have finally found it. Continue Reading Peter Dejong / AP The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms Olga Khazan A single dose of magic mushrooms can make people with severe anxiety and depression better for months, according to a landmark pair of new studies. The doom hung like an anvil over her head. In 2012, a few years after Carol Vincent was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she was waiting to see whether her cancer would progress enough to require chemotherapy or radiation. The disease had already done a number on her, inflating lymph nodes on her chin, collar bones, and groin. She battled her symptoms while running her own marketing business. To top it all off, she was going through menopause. “Life is just pointless stress, and then you die,” she thought. “All I’m doing is sitting here waiting for all this shit to happen.” When one day at an intersection she mulled whether it would be so bad to get hit by a car, she realized her mental health was almost as depleted as her physical state. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Most American Christians Believe They’re Victims of Discrimination Emma Green They say religious discrimination against Christians is as big a problem as discrimination against other groups. Many, many Christians believe they are subject to religious discrimination in the United States. A new report from the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings offers evidence: Almost half of Americans say discrimination against Christians is as big of a problem as discrimination against other groups, including blacks and minorities. Three-quarters of Republicans and Trump supporters said this, and so did nearly eight out of 10 white evangelical Protestants. Of the latter group, six in 10 believe that although America once was a Christian nation, it is no longer—a huge jump from 2012. Polling data can be split up in a million different ways. It’s possible to sort by ethnicity, age, political party, and more. The benefit of sorting by religion, though, is that it highlights people’s beliefs: the way their ideological and spiritual convictions shape their self-understanding. This survey suggests that race is not enough to explain the sense of loss some white Americans seem to feel about their country, although it’s part of the story; the same is true of age, education level, and political affiliation. People’s beliefs seem to have a distinctive bearing on how they view changes in American culture, politics, and law—and whether they feel threatened. No group is more likely to express this fear than conservative Christians. Continue Reading Louisa Gouliamaki / AFP / Getty The Most Mysterious Object in the History of Technology Adrienne LaFrance Multispectral scanning reveals ancient text on the fabled Antikythera Mechanism, and suggests the machine was a mechanical textbook. It was, as they say, a dark and stormy night. The passengers on the enormous ship probably didn’t realize they were in danger until the moment their vessel slammed into the cliffs of Antikythera, Greece. As the ship sank and broke apart, its remnants drifted downward to a seismic terrace some 160 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. More than 2,000 years would pass before fishermen collecting sponges, in the year 1900, discovered the wreckage by accident. Divers then spent a year at the site, where they recovered hundreds of works of art, jewels, and life-sized marble and bronze statues. But they also discovered something they couldn’t explain: A bizarre clockwork-like piece of technology, in the form of a disintegrating lump of corroded bronze, unlike anything known in the ancient world. It come to be known as the Antikythera Mechanism, and it remains one of the most intriguing objects in the history of technology. Continue Reading Eric Miller / Reuters Keith Ellison and the Battle for the Democratic Party David A. Graham The Minnesota progressive’s run for DNC chair demonstrates the pressures for the party as it tries to recover from a disastrous 2016 election. Deciding who will chair a political party probably isn’t the most effective place to fight for the soul of that party. Did Reince Priebus or any of the people who supported his run for Republican National Committee chair foresee president Trump? But DNC chair is the slot that’s open now, so that’s where Democrat are hashing out their differences. Almost all of the pressures on and contradictions within the party can be projected onto Keith Ellison, the U.S. representative from Minnesota, who announced his bid for the spot shortly after the disastrous election for Democrats. That follows several years of disastrous cycles for the party—despite President Obama’s two terms, Democrats have been pummeled at the state and national levels—and the party stewardship of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, which is widely viewed as shiftless and failed. With the Democratic field for 2020 diffuse and enigmatic, the chairmanship is one place to fight the battle. Continue Reading Gustavo da Cunha Pimenta / Flickr Slack, the Facebook Slayer Adrienne LaFrance What if the future of the social web begins in the office? Facebook may be devouring the web, but Slack is increasingly nibbling on a significant portion of it. The group-chat platform announced on Tuesday that it’s partnering with 12 companies to introduce what it calls “message buttons.” The idea is that key functions from outside apps—like using Kayak to search for a flight, or using Greenhouse to approve a document—can be accomplished from within Slack, with the click of a button. “The first dozen apps have already added Message Buttons, and with over 500 apps now available in the Slack App Directory, more interactive integrations are to come,” Slack wrote in a blog post explaining the new feature. (You can watch a demo video on YouTube.) This may not sound surprising. After all, Slack has always found useful ways to integrate third-party apps within its service—or, in Slack’s parlance, to reduce the “context switching” that eats away at productivity. But the move also reveals quite a bit about Slack’s larger ambitions, and may hint at the larger direction of the social web.

Andy Kiersz A very weird thought experiment At the time of this writing, the Powerball jackpot is up to $1.5 billion. The cash grand prize is estimated at $930 million. In a Powerball draw, five white balls are drawn from a drum with 69 balls and one red ball is drawn from a drum with 26 balls. If you match all six numbers, you win the jackpot. If you match only some of the numbers, you win a smaller fixed prize . There are 11,238,513 ways to draw five white balls from a drum of 69 balls . Multiply that by the 26 red balls, and there are a total of 292,201,338 possible Powerball tickets. At $2 for each ticket, then, it would be possible to buy every possible ticket for $584,402,676. As a journalist, I don’t have that much money sitting around, but either a consortium of a few million Americans or a large and wealthy institution like a bank could conceivably assemble that level of cash.

However, if you ask the same person whether he/she is a spiritual person, the answer is not quite that “ready-made” and the person would usually give it a moment’s thought before responding. So, what is it about spirituality that gives it this aura of mysticism? What is spirituality? The meaning of spirituality has been explained in various ways by different gurus. Spirituality might mean different things to different people but these differences are probably superficial. This is sort of like the apparent divorce between science and spirituality. In modern times ,however, the hiatus between the physical sciences and the inner science of spirituality is in the process of being bridged. This is clearly seen as quantum physics and mysticism unite on the same plane and energy healing techniques are gaining ground as being complementary to traditional healing systems. Master Choa Kok Sui’s definition of spirituality as a way of life is simple but speaks of a profound truth. The Path Less Traveled By As a person resolves to start walking on the path of spirituality, besides being determined, the person is often filled with feelings of awe and confusion. Our spiritual toils and battles tend to unsettle us and without the right teacher to guide our efforts, we might end up feeling rudderless in an immense ocean. Grand Master Choa Kok Sui made a very important and valid point when he clarified that spirituality is “not just doing meditation”. However, to be able to even connect to the teacher on the same plane, requires a certain level of spiritual development. How does one achieve such evolution? Most spiritual practitioners would speak of how service, meditation and the attainment of stillness in one’s thoughts and actions are steps towards the ultimate goal of spiritual awakening. The question to be asked here, is not “How to become spiritual?”, but rather, “What is spirituality?”. Is it a process or is it the ultimate state of existence that we all seek? A Journey or a Destination? Taking a rather diplomatic stance, we can probably say that spirituality is both the process and the goal. Therein lies the circularity of spiritual growth. While complete clarity of thoughts and emotions are pre-requisites for spiritual advancement, in reality, the student is frequently under the sway of strong emotions and is pulled in various directions.This leads to doubt and a student might feel overwhelmed by confusion. However, these are mere tests. While the path of spirituality is not an impossible one to walk on, it is not an easy path either. Your Body is Not the Only Thing that Needs Training Your emotional body is made to undergo rigorous training. You need to realize that you control your emotions and not the other way round. Mastery over your emotions is the key that unlocks many doors on your spiritual quest. Just as yoga is painful initially but trains you to gain control over your physical body, controlling your emotions too requires great effort and dedicated practice, but is ultimately rewarding. Just like yoga makes your external body strong, flexible and light, learning to rule over your emotional body provides you with inner strength, inner calmness and inner flexibility. It is a blessing indeed to have Grand Master Choa Kok Sui as a teacher who is intensely loving and kind and watches over his students with great care, always there to guide his students’ spiritual endeavours. He is like the Pole star, ever-constant and always preventing his disciples from getting lost on the vast sea of spirituality. On your spiritual journey, you are bound to face hurdles and obstacles. All you need to do is to keep calm, remember and follow the simple instructions that have been imparted to you in the Pranic Healing and Arhatic Yoga classes. Even if you aren't a part of the Pranic Healing school yet, you might be spiritual in your own way and it's never too late to start!

Any kind of dependence is slavery, and the spiritual dependence is the worst slavery of all. I have been making every effort to make you aware of your individuality, your freedom, your absolute capacity to grow without any help from anybody. Your growth is something intrinsic to your being. It does not come from outside; it is not an imposition, it is an unfolding. All the meditation techniques that I have given to you are not dependent on me – my presence or absence will not make any difference – they are dependent on you. It is not my presence, but your presence that is needed for them to work. It is not my being here but your being here, your being in the present, your being alert and aware that is going to help. The whole past of man is, in different ways, a history of exploitation. And even the so-called spiritual people could not resist the temptation to exploit. Out of a hundred masters, ninety-nine percent were trying to impose the idea that, ""Without me you cannot grow, no progress is possible. Give me your whole responsibility."" But the moment you give your whole responsibility to somebody, unknowingly you are also giving your whole freedom. And naturally, all those masters had to die one day, but they have left long lines of slaves: Christians, Jews, Hindus, Mohammedans. What are these people? Why should somebody be a Christian? If you can be someone, be a Christ, never be a Christian. Are you absolutely blind to the humiliation when you call yourself a Christian, a follower of someone who died two thousand years ago? The whole of humanity is following the dead. Is it not weird that the living should follow the dead, that the living should be dominated by the dead, that the living should depend on the dead and their promises that `We will be coming to save you.´? None of them has come to save you. In fact, nobody can save anybody else; it goes against the foundational truth of freedom and individuality. As far as I am concerned, I am simply making every effort to make you free from everybody – including me – and to just be alone on the path of searching.

We also shall add few other specific options based on guidance given by Pujya Guruji Swami Tejomayananda at various places, occasions and purposes. So we request you to keep your records updated and visit the site regularly for new sadhana, seva and swadhyaya opportunities online. Your Spiritual Goal: Set your goals so high that you are not able to reach them — Gurudev (Bhagavad gita ch 2 verse 49) For each spiritual activity that you complete, you get some spiritual miles. Once you update your miles you cannot go back and reduce them. These goals and miles are only for self – evaluation and tracking and so please update the activity only when you have completed.

Aikid? , also ??? using an older style of kanji ) Literally meaning ""harmony energy way"", or with some poetic license, ""way of the harmonious spirit"", is a gendai budo – a modern Japanese martial art . Practitioners of aikido are known as aikidoka. It was developed by Morihei Ueshiba (????) (also known by aikidoka as o-sensei (???)) over the period of the 1930s to the 1960s. Technically, the major parts of aikido are derived from Dait?-ry? Aiki-j?jutsu (???????), a form of jujutsu with many joint techniques, and kenjutsu (??), or Japanese sword technique (some believe the tactics in Aikido are especially influenced by Yagy? Shinkage-ry? ). Aikido is also considered to contain a significant spiritual component. Akashic Records : ( Akasha is a Sanskrit word meaning ""sky"", ""space"" or "" aether "") Said to be a collection of mystical knowledge that is stored in the aether; i.e. on a non-physical plane of existence. The concept is common in some New Age religious groups. The Akashic Records are said to have existed since the beginning of the planet. Just as we have various specialty libraries (e.g., medical, law), there are said to exist various Akashic Records (e.g., human, animal, plant, mineral, etc.). Most writings refer to the Akashic Records in the area of human experience. Ancestor worship : (??), also ancestor veneration (??) A religious practice based on the belief that one's ancestors possess supernatural powers. Anomalous phenomenon: An observed phenomenon for which there is no suitable explanation in the context of a specific body of scientific knowledge (e.g. astronomy or biology ). Asceticism : Denotes a life which is characterised by refraining from worldly pleasures ( austerity ). Those who practice ascetic lifestyles often perceive their practices as virtuous and pursue them to achieve greater spirituality . Atheism : In the broadest sense, is the absence of belief in the existence of deities . Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with theism , which, in its most general form, is the belief that at least one deity. B [ edit ] Bagua (concept) : ( Chinese : ?? ; pinyin : b? guà ; Wade–Giles : pa kua ; literally: ""eight trigrams"", Korean ???: ??) A fundamental philosophical concept in ancient China. It is an octagonal diagram with eight trigrams on each side. The concept of bagua is applied not only to Chinese Taoist thought and the I Ching , but is also used in other domains of Chinese culture, such as fengshui , martial arts , navigation , etc. Bahá'í Faith : An emerging global religion founded by Bahá'u'lláh , a nineteenth-century Iranian exile. Blessing : (from to bless , Old English bleodsian or bletsian ) Originally meant ""sprinkling with blood "" during the pagan sacrifices, the Blóts (reference: AHD ). A blessing, (also used to refer to bestowing of such) is the infusion of something with holiness , divine will, or one's hopes. Within Roman Catholicism , Eastern Orthodoxy , and similar traditions, formal blessings of the church are performed by bishops , priests , and sometimes deacons , but as in many other religions, anyone may formally bless another. C [ edit ] Chakra : In Hinduism and its spiritual systems of yoga and in some related eastern cultures, as well as in some segments of the New Age movement—and to some degree the distinctly different New Thought movement—a chakra is thought to be an energy node in the human body . Chant : The rhythmic speaking or singing of words or sounds , either on a single pitch or with a simple melody involving a limited set of notes and often including a great deal of repetition or statis. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened form of speech which is more effective in conveying emotion or expressing ones spiritual side. Channelling : The act of having spirits enter or possess one's body in order to speak and act through one as practised in many cultures and religions. Creation : The term creation refers to the beginnings of humanity , earth , life , and the universe ( cosmogony ). Creation may explain that the beginnings of the universe were a deliberate act of "" Creation "" by a supreme being . Consciousness : A quality of the mind generally regarded to comprise qualities such as subjectivity , self-awareness , sentience , sapience , and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment . Many philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness which is experience itself and access consciousness which is the processing of the things in experience. Many cultures and religious traditions place the seat of consciousness in a soul separate from the body. Conversely, many scientists and philosophers consider consciousness to be intimately linked to the neural functioning of the brain dictating the way in which the world is experienced. This aspect of consciousness is the subject of much debate and research in philosophy of mind , psychology , brain biology , neurology , and cognitive science . Contemplation : A type of prayer or meditation in the Christian , especially Catholic , tradition. It is an attempt to experience God directly. It is connected to Christiam mysticism , and authors such as Teresa of Avila , Margery Kempe , Augustine Baker and Thomas Merton have written about it extensively. It is briefly described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church , paragraphs 2709 onwards, where the Song of Songs is quoted. Cosmogony : [Gr. Kosmogonia from Kosmos the world and root of gignesthai to be born] The coming into existence , the creation and origination of the universe . It is also the study of these aspects. So a cosmogony describes how the Universe came to be; hence, the creation myth in the Book of Genesis is one such cosmogony, and there are many others, both scientific and mythological . This contrasts with cosmology , which studies the Universe at large, throughout its existence. D [ edit ] Deism : Historical and modern deism is defined by the view that reason , rather than revelation or tradition , should be the basis of belief in God. Deists reject organized religion and promote reason as the essential element in making moral decisions. This ""rational"" basis was usually founded upon the cosmological argument (first cause argument), the teleological argument (argument from design), and other aspects of what was called natural religion . Deism has become identified with the classical belief that God created but does not intervene in the world, though this is not a necessary component of deism. Deity : (or a god) A postulated preternatural being, usually, but not always, of significant power, worshipped , thought holy , divine , or sacred , held in high regard, or respected by human beings. They assume a variety of forms, but are frequently depicted as having human or animal form. Sometimes it is considered blasphemous to imagine the deity as having any concrete form. They are usually immortal . They are commonly assumed to have personalities and to possess consciousness, intellects, desires, and emotions much like humans. Such natural phenomena as lightning, floods, storms, other ""acts of God”, and miracles are attributed to them, and they may be thought to be the authorities or controllers of every aspect of human life (such as birth or the afterlife ). Some deities are asserted to be the directors of time and fate itself, to be the givers of human law and morality, to be the ultimate judges of human worth and behavior, and to be the designers and creators of the Earth or the universe . Some of these ""gods"" have no power at all-they are simply worshipped. Dhammapada : ( Pali , translates as Path of the Dharma . Also Prakrit Dhamapada , Sanskrit Dharmapada ) A Buddhist religious scripture , containing 423 verses in 26 categories. According to tradition, these are answers to questions put to the Buddha on various occasions, most of which deal with ethics . Dharma : ( sanskrit , roughly law or way ) The way of the higher Truths. Beings that live in harmony with Dharma proceed quicker towards moksha , nirvana , or personal liberation , a concept first taught in Indian religions ( Hinduism , Buddhism , Jainism and Sikhism ). Dhikr : Arabic. (""pronouncement"", "" invocation "" or "" remembrance "") also spelled zikr based on its pronunciation in Turkish and Persian . Dhikr is the remembrance of God commanded in the Qur'an for all Muslims . To engage in dhikr is to have awareness of God according to Islam . Dhikr as a devotional act includes the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from hadith literature, and sections of the Qur'an. More generally, any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of God is considered dhikr. E [ edit ] Emanationism : Technically is a henotheism component in the cosmology of certain religious or philosophical systems that argue a Supreme Being did not directly create the physical universe , but instead emanated lower spiritual beings who created the world. Enlightenment : As a concept is related to the Buddhist Bodhi but is a cornerstone of religious and spiritual understanding in practically all religions . It literally means being illuminated by acquiring new wisdom or understanding. Entheogen : A modern term derived from two Ancient Greek words, ?????? ( entheos ) and ???????? ( genesthai ). Entheos means literally ""in God"", more freely translated ""inspired"". The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. Genesthai means ""to cause to be"". So an entheogen is ""that which causes (a person) to be in God"". The translation ""creating the divine within"" that is sometimes given is not quite correct -- entheogen implies neither that something is created (as opposed to just perceiving something that is already there) nor that that which is experienced is within the user (as opposed to having independent existence). Epigenesis : The philosophical / theological / esoteric idea that since the mind was given to the human being, it is this original creative impulse, epigenesis, which has been the cause of all of mankind 's development. Epiphany : ( Greek : ????????? , ""the appearance; miraculous phenomenon"") A Christian feast intended to celebrate the 'shining forth' or revelation of God to mankind in human form, in the person of Jesus . The observance had its origins in the eastern Christian churches, and included the birth of Jesus; the visit of the three Magi (Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar) who arrived in Bethlehem ; and all of Jesus' childhood events, up to his baptism in the Jordan by John the Baptist . The feast was initially based on, and viewed as a fulfillment of, the Jewish Feast of Lights . This was fixed on January 6. Eschatology : (from the Greek eschatos meaning ""last"" + -logy ) A part of theology concerned with the final events in the history of the world or the ultimate fate of human kind , commonly phrased as the end of the world. In many religions , the end of the world is a future event prophesied in sacred texts or folklore . More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the messiah or messianic era, the afterlife , and the soul . Esotericism : Refers to knowledge suitable only for the advanced, privileged, or initiated, as opposed to exoteric knowledge , which is public. It is used especially for mystical , occult and spiritual viewpoints. Eternal return : (or sometimes eternal recurrence) A concept originating from ancient Egypt and developed in the teachings of Pythagoras . Eternity : While in the popular mind, eternity often simply means existing for an infinite , i.e., limitless, amount of time , many have used it to refer to a timeless existence altogether outside of time. There are a number of arguments for eternity , by which proponents of the concept, principally, Aristotle , purported to prove that matter, motion, and time must have existed eternally. Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism : Eutheism and dystheism are dialectic opposites within the spectrum of theistic religious beliefs. Eutheism is the belief that God exists and is good . Dystheism is the belief that God exists but is not good. Existence : There is no universally accepted theory of what the word existence means. The dominant (though by no means universal) view in twentieth-century and contemporary Anglo-American philosophy is that existence is what is asserted by statements of first-order logic of the form ""for some x Fx"". This agrees with the simple and commonsensical view that, in uttering ""There is a bridge across the Thames at Hammersmith"", or ""A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith"", we are asserting the existence of a bridge across the Thames at Hammersmith. The word ""existence"", on this view, is simply a way of describing the Logical Form of ordinary subject-predicate sentence. Exorcism : The practice of evicting demons or other evil spiritual entities which are supposed to have possessed (taken control of) a person or object. The practice, though ancient in roots, is still part of the belief system of many religions . The word ""exorcism"" means ""I cause [someone] to swear,"" referring to the exorcist forcing the spirit to obey a higher power. F [ edit ] Faith healing : The use of solely spiritual means in treating disease , sometimes accompanied with the refusal of modern medical techniques. Another term for this is spiritual healing. Faith healing is a form of alternative medicine . Fasting : The act of willingly abstaining from all food and in some cases drink , for a period of time. Depending on the tradition, fasting practices may forbid sexual intercourse , (or any sexual desire), masturbation , as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food (e.g. meat ). Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the Qur'an , in the Mahabharata , in the Upanishads , and in the Bible , in both the Old and New Testament . G [ edit ] Glossolalia : (from the Greek, ""??????"" (glossa), tongue and ""????"" (lalô), to speak) comprises the utterance of what appears (to the casual listener) either as an unknown foreign language (xenoglossia), meaningless syllables, or utterance of an unknown mystical language; the utterances sometimes occur as part of religious worship (religious glossolalia) Gnosticism : A blanket term for various mystical initiatory religions , sects and knowledge schools, which were most prominent in the first few centuries AD. It is also applied to modern revivals of these groups and, sometimes, by analogy to all religious movements based on secret knowledge gnosis, thus can lead to confusion. God : The term God is capitalized in the English language as a proper noun when used to refer to a specific monotheistic concept of a supernatural Supreme Being in accordance with Christian , Jewish (sometimes as ""G-d"" - cf. Names of God in Judaism ), and more recently (in the U.S.A) Muslim and some Hindu traditions. Goddess : The term Goddess is likewise capitalized in many cultures, though not necessarily in the English language (due to the predominance of Judeo-Christian sects and their monotheistic perception of solely one God ); however, many religions around the world look upon Goddess as being an equally Supreme Being in accordance with their own doctrines, pantheons, and traditions. She is often looked upon as being a wife of a specific God; however, in many faiths, She has Her own unique identity and is often worshiped separate and apart from God, or perhaps in conjunction with. Great Awakenings : Commonly said to be periods of religious revival in Anglo-American religious history. They have also been described as periodic revolutions in American religious thought. The Great Awakenings appear to form a cycle, with a period of roughly 80 years. There are three generally accepted Great Awakenings in American history: The First Great Awakening (1730s - 1740s); The Second Great Awakening (1820s - 1830s); The Third Great Awakening (1880s - 1900s). Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji ( Punjabi : ???? ???? ????? ????? ?? ): Granth is Punjabi for book; Sahib is Hindi meaning master, from Arabic , meaning companion, friend, owner, or master – is more than a holy book of the Sikhs . The Sikhs treat this Granth ( holy book ) as a living Guru . The holy text spans 1430 pages and contains the actual words spoken by the founders of the Sikh religion and various other Saints from other religions including Hinduism and Islam . Guru : ( Sanskrit : ???? , Punjabi : ???? ) A teacher in Hinduism , Buddhism or Sikhism . Based on a long line of philosophical understanding as to the importance of knowledge, the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred conduit , or a way to self-realization . In India and among people of Hindu , Buddhist , or Sikh belief, the title retains a hallowed meaning. Guru also refers in Sanskrit to Brihaspati , a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god Jupiter . In Vedic astrology , Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences. Indeed, in many Indian languages , such as Hindi , the occidental Thursday is called either Brihaspativaar or Guruvaar ( vaar meaning period or day). In contemporary India and Indonesia , guru is widely used within the general meaning of ""teacher"". In Western usage, the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers, and not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion. In a further metaphorical extension, guru is used of a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise. The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role. The assessment and criticism of gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition are espoused in the discourse about cults and new religious movements by Western secular scholars, theologians , anti-cultists , and by skeptics both in the West and in India. H [ edit ] Hymn : A song specifically written as a song of praise, adoration or prayer , typically addressed to a god . A writer of hymns is known as a hymnist or hymnodist, and the process of singing a hymn is called hymnody ; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. ""nineteenth century Methodist hymnody"" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the nineteenth century). Books called hymnals are collections of hymns, which may or may not include music. Ancient hymns include the Great Hymn to the Aten , composed by the pharaoh Akhenaten , and the Vedas , a collection of hymns in the tradition of Hinduism . The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the Homeric Hymns , a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BCE in praise of the gods of Greek mythology . I [ edit ] I Ching : The oldest of the Chinese classic texts . It describes an ancient system of cosmology and philosophy which is at the heart of Chinese cultural beliefs. The philosophy centers on the ideas of the dynamic balance of opposites , the evolution of events as a process, and acceptance of the inevitability of change (see Philosophy , below). In Western cultures, the I Ching is regarded by some as simply a system of divination ; others believe it expresses the wisdom and philosophy of ancient China . Iconolatry : (from the two Greek terms eikon denoting simply a picture or image, and latreia to adore or worship) Icon in Greek simply denotes a picture but has now come to be closely associated with religious art used by the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches . Icons are used by Orthodox Churches to assist in prayer and worship of God. Icon (image) is the same word used in the Bible in Genesis 1:27, Colossians 1:15. Inner peace : (or peace of mind) A colloquialism that refers to a state of being mentally or spiritually at peace , with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress . Being ""at peace"" is considered by many to be healthy ( homeostasis ) and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness . Most religious people believe that it is only truly possible to achieve inner peace with divine intervention of some form or another. Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as prayer , meditation , T'ai Chi Ch'uan or yoga , for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself . Integrity : Comprises the personal inner sense of ""wholeness"" deriving from honesty and consistent uprightness of character . The etymology of the word relates it to the Latin adjective integer (whole, complete). Evaluators, of course, usually assess integrity from some point of view , such as that of a given ethical tradition or in the context of an ethical relationship . Involution : In Ken Wilber's Integral theory (Ken Wilber)integral theory , the process by which the Divine manifests the cosmos is called involution. The process by which the creation rises to higher states and states of consciousness is the evolution . Involution prepares the universe for the Big Bang ; evolution continues from that point forward. The term involution comes from the idea that the divine involves itself in creation. After the creation, the Divine (i.e. the Absolute , Brahman , God ; all these essentially mean the same thing) is both the One (the Creator) and the Many (that which was created). J [ edit ] Japa : (or Japam) A spiritual discipline in which a devotee repeats a mantra or the name of the God . The repetition can be aloud or just the movement of lips or in the mind. This spiritual practice is present in the major religions of world. This is considered as one of the most effective spiritual practices. Jihad : ( Arabic : ???? ?? jih?d ) An Islamic term , from the Arabic root jhd (""to exert utmost effort, to strive, struggle""), which connotes a wide range of meanings: anything from an inward spiritual struggle to attain perfect faith to a political or military struggle to further the Islamic cause. The meaning of ""Islamic cause"" is of course open to interpretation. The term is frequently mistranslated into English as "" holy war "", although jihad can apply to warfare. Mainstream Muslims consider jihad to be the most misunderstood aspect of their religion by non-Muslims. The Islamic religious legitimacy of the goals or methods of various Islamist movements who adopt the terminology of jihad is often brought into question, usually by moderate and liberal Muslims . K [ edit ] Karma : ( Sanskrit : ???? from the root kri, ""to do"", meaning deed ) or Kamma ( Pali : meaning action, effect, destiny ) A term in several Indian religions that comprises the entire cycle of cause and effect . Karma is a sum of all that an individual has done and is currently doing. The effects of those deeds actively create present and future experiences, thus making one responsible for one's own life. In religions that incorporate reincarnation , karma extends through one's present life and all past and future lives as well. Koan : A story , dialog , question, or statement in the history and lore of Chan ( Zen ) Buddhism , generally containing aspects that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet that may be accessible to Intuition . Koans are often used by Zen practitioners as objects of meditation to induce an experience of enlightenment or realization, and by Zen teachers as testing questions when a student wishes to validate their experience of enlightenment. L [ edit ] Lataif-e-Sitta : Drawing from Qur'anic verses, virtually all Sufis distinguish Lataif-e-Sitta (The six subtleties), Nafs , Qalb , Sirr , Ruh , Khafi & Akhfa . These lataif (sing : latifa) designate various psychospiritual ""organs"" or, sometimes, faculties of sensory and suprasensory perception. In a rough assessment, they might appear to correlate with glands , organs , Chinese traditional or vedic chakras . In general, sufic development involves the awakening in a certain order these spiritual centers of perception that lie dormant in every person. Each center is associated with a particular color and general area of the body, as well as ofttimes with a particular prophet, and varies from Order to Order. The help of a guide is considered necessary to help activate these centers. The activation of all these ""centers"" is part of the inner methodology of the Sufi way or ""Work"". After undergoing this process, the dervish is said to reach a certain type of ""completion"" or becomes a Complete Man. Love : Has many different meanings in English , from something that gives a little pleasure (""I loved that meal"") to something one would die for ( patriotism , pairbonding). It can describe an intense feeling of affection , an emotion or an emotional state. In ordinary use, it usually refers to interpersonal love. Probably due to its psychological relevance, love is one of the most common themes in art. Just as there are many types of lovers, there are many kinds of love. Love is inherent in all human cultures. It is precisely these cultural differences that make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. See the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis . Expressions of love may include the love for a ""soul"" or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, love for the respect of others, et cetera. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain. M [ edit ] Mantra : A religious syllable or poem , typically from the Sanskrit language. Their use varies according to the school and philosophy associated with the mantra. They are primarily used as spiritual conduits , words and vibrations that instill one-pointed concentration in the devotee. Other purposes have included religious ceremonies to accumulate wealth, avoid danger, or eliminate enemies. Mantras originated in India with Vedic Hinduism and were later adopted by Buddhists and Jains , now popular in various modern forms of spiritual practice which are loosely based on practices of these Eastern religions. Meaning of life : The question “What is the meaning of life?” means different things to different people. The ambiguity of the query is inherent in the word “meaning”, which opens the question to many interpretations, such as: “What is the origin of life ?” , “What is the nature of life (and of the universe in which we live)?” , “What is the significance of life?” , “What is valuable in life?” , and “What is the purpose of, or in, (one's) life?” . These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from practical scientific theories, to philosophical , theological and spiritual explanations. Similar questions people ask themselves about the origin and purpose of life are “Why am I here?” and “Why are we here?”. Meditation : Refers to any of a wide variety of spiritual practices (and their close secular analogues) which emphasize mental activity or quiescence. The English word comes from the Latin meditatio , which could perhaps be better translated as "" contemplation ."" This usage is found in Christian spirituality , for example, when one ""meditates"" on the sufferings of Christ; as well as Western philosophy, as in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy , a set of six mental exercises which systematically analyze the nature of reality. In the late nineteenth century, Theosophists adopted ""meditation"" to refer to various spiritual practices drawn from Hinduism , Buddhism , and other Eastern religions . Thus the English word ""meditation"" does not exclusively translate any single term or concept from the sacred languages of Asia, such as the Sanskrit dhyana , sam?dhi , or pranayama . (Note that whereas in Eastern religions meditation is often a central part of religious/spiritual practice, in Christianity it is rather a fringe activity if practised at all.) Metaphysics : ( Greek words meta = after/beyond and physics = nature) A branch of philosophy concerned with the study of ""first principles"" and ""being"" ( ontology ). Problems that were not originally considered metaphysical have been added to metaphysics. Other problems that were considered metaphysical problems for centuries are now typically relegated to their own separate subheadings in philosophy, such as philosophy of religion , philosophy of mind , philosophy of perception , philosophy of language , and philosophy of science . In rare cases subjects of metaphysical research have been found to be entirely physical and natural, thus making them part of physics . Mind's eye : (or third eye) A phrase used to refer to one's ability to "" see "" things (such as visions ) with the mind . This is, essentially, a reference to imagination and memory , although it can have religious or occult connotations. Also, the term ""third eye"" has been associated with the Pineal gland . It is a commonly held belief that in some practices (such as the ones described below) are actually referring to and studying the Pineal Gland. Miracle : According to many religions , a miracle, derived from the Latin word miraculum meaning 'something wonderful', is a striking interposition of divine intervention by God in the universe by which the operations of the ordinary course of Nature are overruled, suspended, or modified. One must keep in mind that in Judaism , Christianity , Islam and in other faiths people have substantially different definitions of the word miracle . Even within a specific religion there is often more than one usage of the term. Sometimes the term miracle may refer to the action of a supernatural being that is not a god. Then the term divine intervention refers specifically to the direct involvement of a deity. Moksha : ( Sanskrit : ?????, liberation ) or Mukti ( Sanskrit : ????????, release ) Refers, in general, to liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth . In higher Hindu philosophy , it is seen as a transcendence of phenomenal being, of any sense of consciousness of time , space , and causation ( karma ). It is not seen as a soteriological goal in the same sense as in, say, a Christian context, but signifies dissolution of the sense of self, or ego , and the overall breakdown of nama-roopa (name-form). It is, in Hinduism , viewed as analogous to Nirvana , though Buddhist thought tends to differ with even the Advaita Vedantist reading of liberation. Jainism and Surat Shabda Yoga traditions also believe in Moksha. Muraqaba : The Sufi word for meditation . Literally it means ""to watch over"", ""to take care of"" or ""to keep an eye"". Metaphorically , it implies that with meditation, a person watches over or takes care of his spiritual heart (or soul), and acquires knowledge about it, its surroundings and its creator. Mysticism : From the Greek ??? ( mueo , ""to conceal""), is the pursuit of achieving communion with or conscious awareness of ultimate reality , the divine , spiritual truth , or God through direct, personal experience (intuition or insight) rather than rational thought; the belief in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible through personal experience; or the belief that such experience is a genuine and important source of knowledge. In the Hellenistic world, ""mystical"" referred to secret religious rituals. N [ edit ] Nasma : A body made of the purest form of light (called Noor) which is more pure than any visible color. Hazrat Shah Wali Ullah was the first who give hints about this body. Hazrat Qalandar Baba Auliya give its more details while Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi thoroughly described that body. This body is actually that is controlling the human physical body. The lights coming from Nasma to material body are visible only through Kirlian photography . These visible lights are called Aura. Neopaganism : (sometimes Neo-Paganism) Describes a heterogeneous group of new religious movements which attempt to revive ancient, mainly pre- Christian and often pre- Judaic Indo-European religions . As the name implies, these religions are Pagan in nature, though their exact relationship to older forms of Paganism is the source of much contention. New Age : Describes a broad movement of late twentieth century and contemporary Western culture characterised by an individual eclectic approach to spiritual exploration. It has some attributes of a new, emerging religion but is currently a loose network of spiritual seekers, teachers, healers and other participants. The name ""New Age"" also refers to the market segment in which goods and services are sold to people in the movement. Nirvana : In the Indian religions Buddhism , Jainism and Hinduism , nirv?na (from the Sanskrit ???????, Pali : Nibb?na -- Chinese : ??; Pinyin : niè pán), literally ""extinction"" and/or ""extinguishing"", is the culmination of the yogi's pursuit of liberation. Siddhartha Gautama , the Buddha, described the Dharma as a raft which, after floating across a river , will enable the passenger to reach nirvana. Hinduism and Jainism also use the word nirvana to describe the state of moksha , and it is spoken of in several Hindu tantric texts as well as the Bhagavad Gita . Nondualism : The belief that dualism or dichotomy are illusory phenomenae. Examples of dualisms include self/other, mind/body, male/female, good/evil, active/passive, and many others. A nondual philosophical or religious perspective or theory maintains that there is no fundamental distinction between mind and matter , or that the entire phenomenological world is an illusion (with the reality being described variously as the Void, the Is, Emptiness, or the Mind of God). O [ edit ] Oneness : A spiritual term referring to the 'experience' of the absence of egoic identity boundaries, and, according to some traditions, the realization of the awareness of the absolute interconnectedness of all matter and thought in space-time , or one's ultimate identity with God (see Tat Tvam Asi ). Its meaning may be synonymous to that of nonduality , though some claim that non-duality implies 'not one' and 'not two', i.e. non-duality is analogous to the Hindu formula of negation , Neti Neti, used in describing the absolute . P [ edit ] Pandeism : ( Greek pan =all, en =in and Latin Deus =God; ""all-in-God"") is a term generally used to describe philosophical systems, often mixing elements of pantheism and deism . This use has been inconsistent over time. Panentheism ( Greek words: pan =all, en =in and Theos =God; ""all-in-God"") is the view that God is both immanent within all creation , and also maintains a transcendent character. Pantheism : ( Greek : pan = all and Theos = God) Literally means "" God is All "" and ""All is God"". It is the view that everything is of an all-encompassing immanent God; or that the universe , or nature , and God are equivalent. More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that natural law , existence and/or the universe (the sum total of all that it was and shall be) is represented or personified in the theological principle of 'God'. Parapsychology : The study of the evidence involving phenomena where a person seems to affect or to gain information about something through a means not currently explainable within the framework of mainstream, conventional science . Proponents of the existence of these phenomena usually consider them to be a product of unexplained mental abilities. Physical universe : The part of the universe composed of matter , as opposed to a spiritual or supernatural essence. Pilgrimage : A term primarily used in religion and spirituality of a long journey or search of great moral significance. Sometimes, it is a journey to a sacred place or shrine of importance to a person's beliefs and faith . Members of every religion participate in pilgrimages. A person who makes such a journey is called a pilgrim . Plane (cosmology) : In metaphysics and esoteric cosmology , a plane of existence (sometimes called simply a plane, dimension, vibrating plane, or an inner, invisible, spiritual, supraphysical world or egg ) is a theoretical region of space and/or consciousness beyond the known physical universe , or the region containing the universe itself. Many esoteric teachings (e.g., theosophy and rosicrucianism ) propound the idea of a whole series of subtle planes or worlds or dimensions which, from a center, interpenetrate themselves and the physical planet in which we live, the solar systems , and all the physical structures of the universe . This interpenetration of planes culminates in the universe itself as a physical structured, dynamic and evolutive expression emanated – through a series of stages, becoming progressively more material and embodied – from The Supreme Being : which allows from Itself the irruption of auto-Singularities, as the Big Bang , originated from Its unintelligible Chaos . Prayer : An effort to communicate with God , or to some deity or deities, or another form of spiritual entity, or otherwise, either to offer praise , to make a request, or simply to express one's thoughts and emotions. Prophecy : In a broad sense, is the prediction of future events. The etymology of the word is ultimately Greek, from pro- ""before"" plus the root of phanai ""speak"", i. e. ""speaking before"" or ""foretelling"", but prophecy often implies the involvement of supernatural phenomena, whether it is communication with a deity, the reading of magical signs, or astrology . It is also used as a general term for the revelation of divine will. Throughout history, people have sought knowledge of future events from special individuals or groups who were thought to have the gift of prophecy, such as Oracles at Delphi in ancient Greece. Cultures in which prophecy played an important role include the North American Indians , Mayans , Celts , Druids , Chinese , Chaldeans , Assyrians , Egyptians , Hindus , Hebrews , Tibetans , Greeks , and many in the Christian tradition, among others. Q [ edit ] Qi : Also commonly spelled ch'i , chi or ki , is a fundamental concept of everyday Chinese culture, most often defined as ""air"" or ""breath"" (for example, the colloquial Mandarin Chinese term for "" weather "" is ti?n qi , or the ""breath of heaven"") and, by extension, ""life force"" or ""spiritual energy"" that is part of everything that exists. References to qi or similar philosophical concepts as a type of metaphysical energy that sustains living beings are used in many belief systems, especially in Asia . Qigong : ( simplified Chinese : ?? ; traditional Chinese : ?? ; pinyin : qìg?ng ; Wade–Giles : ch'i 4 kung 1 ) An increasingly popular aspect of Chinese medicine involving the coordination of different breathing patterns with various physical postures and motions of the body. Qigong is mostly taught for health maintenance purposes, but there are also some who teach it, especially in China, for therapeutic interventions. Various forms of traditional qigong are also widely taught in conjunction with Chinese martial arts , and are especially prevalent in the advanced training of what are known as the neijia (internal martial arts). R [ edit ] Reality : In everyday usage means ""everything that exists."" The term ""Reality,"" in its most liberal sense, includes everything that is, whether or not it is observable, accessible or understandable by science, philosophy, theology or any other system of analysis. Reality in this sense may include both being and nothingness , whereas "" existence "" is often restricted to being. Reincarnation : As a doctrine or mystical belief, holds the notion that one's ' Spirit ' (' Soul ' depending on interpretation), 'Higher or True Self', 'Divine Spark', 'I' or 'Ego' (not to be confused with the ego as defined by psychology) or critical parts of these returns to the material world after physical death to be reborn in a new body. The natural process is considered integrative of all experiences from each lifetime. A new personality feature, with the associated character , is developed during each life in the physical world, based upon past integrated experience and new acquired experiences. Some Reincarnation theories express that usually rebirth is made each time in alternated female and male type of bodies. Also that there is interaction between pre-determinism of certain experiences or lessons intended to happen during the physical life, and the free-will action of the individual as they live that life. Religion : Sometimes used interchangeably with faith or belief system—is commonly defined as belief concerning the supernatural , sacred , or divine ; and the moral codes , practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. In its broadest sense some have defined it as the sum total of answers given to explain humankind's relationship with the universe. In the course of the development of religion , it has taken many forms in various cultures and individuals. Occasionally, the word ""religion"" is used to designate what should be more properly described as ""organized religion"" – that is, an organization of people supporting the exercise of some religion, often taking the form of a legal entity (see religion-supporting organization ). There are many different religions in the world today. Religious ecstasy : A trance-like state characterized by expanded mental and spiritual awareness and is frequently accompanied by visions, hallucinations, and physical euphoria. Such an experience usually lasts about a half-hour. However, there are many records of such experiences lasting several days, and some people claim to have experienced ecstasy over a period of over three decades, or to have recurring experiences of ecstasy during their lifetime. Repentance : The feeling and act in which one recognizes and tries to right a wrong, or gain forgiveness from someone that they wronged. In religious contexts it usually refers to repenting for a sin against God . It always includes an admission of guilt, and also includes at least one of: a solemn promise or resolve not to repeat the offense; an attempt to make restitution for the wrong, or in some way to reverse the harmful effects of the wrong where possible. Responsibility assumption : A doctrine in the spirituality and personal growth fields holding that each individual has substantial or total responsibility for the events and circumstances that befall them in their life . While there is little notable about the notion that each person has at least some role in shaping their experience, the doctrine of responsibility assumption posits that the individual's mental contribution to his or her own experience is substantially greater than is normally thought. ""I must have wanted this"" is the type of catchphrase used by adherents of this doctrine when encountering situations, pleasant or unpleasant, to remind them that their own desires and choices led to the present outcome. The term responsibility assumption thus has a specialized meaning beyond the general concept of taking responsibility for something, and is not to be confused with the general notion of making an assumption that a concept such as ""responsibility"" exists. Revelation : Refers to an uncovering or disclosure of that which had been previously wholly or partly hidden via communication from the divine. In monotheistic religions, revelation is the process in which God makes himself, his will, and/or other information known to mankind. The recipient of revelation is commonly referred to as a prophet , and sometimes is termed a messenger. There are a number of ways that religious thinkers have traditionally approached this topic; many widely differing views have been proposed. Generally speaking, one can find all of the following viewpoints in varying segments of Judaism and in varying groups within Christianity . Revivalism : A revival is the apparent restoration of a living creature from a dead state to a living state. In a New Testament story, Lazarus was revived by divine intervention. In religious terms, Revival is the substitution of religious fervor in life and worship, for an intellectualized, pragmatic approach to everyday conduct (often stigmatized by revivalists as 'pride'). Ritual : A formalised, predetermined set of symbolic actions generally performed in a particular environment at a regular, recurring interval. The set of actions that comprise a ritual often include, but are not limited to, such things as recitation, singing , group processions, repetitive dance , manipulation of sacred objects, etc. The general purpose of rituals is to express some fundamental truth or meaning, evoke spiritual, numinous emotional responses from participants, and/or engage a group of people in unified action to strengthen their communal bonds. The word ritual, when used as an adjective, relates to the noun ' rite ', as in rite of passage . S [ edit ] Sacrifice : (from a Middle English verb meaning 'to make sacred', from Old French , from Latin sacrificium : sacer, sacred; sacred + facere, to make) Commonly known as the practice of offering food, or the lives of animals or people to the gods , as an act of propitiation or worship . The term is also used metaphorically to describe selfless good deeds for others. Sadhana : Spiritual exercise by a Sadhu or a Sadhaka to attain a desired goal. The goal of sadhana is to attain some stage, which can be either moksha , liberation from the cycle of birth and death ( Samsara ), or a particular goal such as the blessing by a deity through his or her appearance before the Sadhaka at the end of the limited Sadhana. Sadhana can involve meditation , puja to a deity, namasmarana (sometimes with the help of a japa mala ), mortification of the flesh or unorthodox practices such as in a smashana sadhana on a cremation ground. Each type of Yoga entails its own type of sadhana. To embark on a sadhana, a guru is required to give one the necessary know-how and the seed for the future result, in the form of some diksha , initiation, which he or she has received from his or her guru. Saint : Generally refers to someone who is exceptionally virtuous and holy . It can be applied to both the living and the dead and is an acceptable term in most of the world's popular religions. The Saint is held up by the community as an example of how we all should act, and his or her life story is usually recorded for the edification of future generations. The process of officially recognizing a person as a Saint, practiced by some churches, is called canonization , though many Protestant groups use the less formal, broader usage seen in Scripture to include all who are faithful as saints. Salvation : Refers to deliverance from undesirable state or condition. In theology , the study of salvation is called soteriology and is a vitally important concept in several religions. Christianity regards salvation as deliverance from the bondage of sin and from condemnation, resulting in eternal life with God . Satguru : (or Sadguru) Means true guru (Sanskrit ?????? sat=true), literally: true teacher. The title means that his students have faith that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to moksha , enlightenment or inner peace . It is based on a long line of Hindu philosophical understandings of the importance of knowledge and that the teacher, guru, is the sacred conduit to self-realization. SBNR : Acronym used by individuals who define themselves as Spiritual But Not Religious. Self-realization: In yoga , self-realization is knowledge of one's true self. This true self is also referred to as the atma to avoid ambiguity. The term ""self-realization"" is a translation of the Sanskrit expression atma jnana (knowledge of the self or atma). The reason the term ""realization"" is used instead of ""knowledge"" is that jnana refers to knowledge based on experience, not mere intellectual knowledge. As discussed in the article on yoga , while the goal of self-realization is the same in all yoga paths, the means used to achieve that goal differ. For example, in hatha yoga , self-realization is said to be achieved when the serpent force or kundalini rises through the shushumna nadi to the sahasrara chakra . The following terms are related to self-realization or atma jnana: moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death); sam?dhi (Supreme or Divine Bliss). Seven Virtues : Derived from the Psychomachia , an epic poem written by Prudentius (c. 410). Practicing these virtues is alleged to protect one against temptation toward the Seven Deadly Sins . The Seven Virtues considered by the Roman Catholic church are those of humility , meekness , charity , chastity , moderation , zeal and generosity . These are considered to be the polar opposite of the seven deadly sins , namely pride , wrath , envy , lust , gluttony , sloth and greed . Shabd : (or Shabda) Literally means “sound” or “word” in Sanskrit. Esoterically, Shabd is the “Sound Current vibrating in all creation. It can be heard by the inner ears.” Variously referred to as the Audible Life Stream, Inner Sound, Sound Current or Word in English, the Shabd is the esoteric essence of God which is available to all human beings, according to the Shabd path teachings of Eckankar , the Quan Yin Method , Sant Mat and Surat Shabd Yoga . Adherents believe that a Satguru , or ECK Master , who is a human being, has merged with the Shabd in such a manner that he or she is a living manifestation of it at its highest level (the “Word made flesh”). However, not only can the Satguru can attain this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way. Indeed, in Sant Mat the raison d’être for the human form is to meditate on the Sound Current, and in so doing merge with it until one’s own divinity is ultimately realized. Shamanism : Refers to the traditional healing and religious practices of Northern Asia ( Siberia ) and Mongolia . By extension, the concept of shamanism has been extended in common language to a range of traditional beliefs and practices that involve the ability to diagnose, cure, and sometimes cause human suffering by traversing the axis mundi and forming a special relationship with, or gaining control over, spirits . Shamans have been credited with the ability to control the weather, divination , the interpretation of dreams, astral projection , and traveling to upper and lower worlds. Shamanistic traditions have existed throughout the world since prehistoric times. Shinto : (?? Shint? ) (sometimes called Shintoism) A native religion of Japan and was once its state religion . It involves the worship of kami , which can be translated to mean gods , spirits of nature, or just spiritual presences. Some kami are local and can be regarded as the spirit or genius of a particular place, but others represent major natural objects and processes, for example, Amaterasu , the Sun goddess . The word Shinto was created by combining two kanji : ""?"" shin meaning god (the character can also be read as ""kami"" in Japanese) and ""?"" t? meaning Tao (""way"" or ""path"" in a philosophical sense). Thus, Shinto means ""the way of the gods."" After World War II, Shinto lost its status of state religion ; some Shinto practices and teachings, once given a great deal of prominence during the war, are no longer taught nor practiced today, and some remain largely as everyday activities without religious connotations like omikuji (a form of sortition ). Shunyata : (??nyat?, ??????? ( Sanskrit , Pali : suññat?), or ""Emptiness"") A term for an aspect of the Buddhist metaphysical critique as well as Buddhist epistemology and phenomenology . Shunyata signifies that everything one encounters in life is empty of soul, permanence, and self-nature. Everything is inter-related, never self-sufficient or independent; nothing has independent reality. Yet shunyata never connotes nihilism , which Buddhist doctrine considers to be a delusion, just as it considers materialism to be a delusion. Simran : 'Simran', derived from the word 'Smarana,' (from Sanskrit), means: remembering or contemplating on the highest – that which should be valued in memory, in general. It teaches that: everything changes while inner and outer purity naturally happen. Smarana does not project about restriction through God or religion. It shows that remembering the highest aspect of life that one has seen will eventually open up what's important to an individual. Soul : The soul, according to many religious and philosophical traditions, is the ethereal substance – spirit ( Hebrew : rooah or nefesh ) – particular to a unique living being . Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife , but opinions may vary wildly, even within a given religion, as to what happens to the soul after death . Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material. Spirit : The English word spirit comes from the Latin spiritus , meaning breath. In religion and spirituality , the respiration of the human being has for obvious reasons been strongly linked with the very occurrence of life. A similar significance has been attributed to human blood . Spirit has thus evolved to denote that which separates a living body from a corpse, but can be used metaphorically (she performed the piece with spirit or she put up a spirited defence) where it is a synonym for such words as 'vivacity'. Spiritism : A religious and philosophic doctrine established in France in the mid-19th century by Allan Kardec . The term was coined by him as the specific name of the doctrine he was about to publish but, given the fact that the word was created from roots taken from the common language, it was soon incorporated into the normal use and has been used to name other doctrines as well, though the authentic Spiritists protest against this usage. During the late 19th century, many well educated people from Europe and the United States embraced Spiritism as a logical explanation of themes related to the Christian Revelation. However, most of the initial enthusiasm receded. But in some places the work of a few dedicated preachers managed to achieve a solid foundation – more notably, in Brazil, and to a certain extent in the Philippines . In Brazil , more than 2 million people declare themselves Kardecist spiritists, according to the last IBGE census data, which makes Brazil the largest Spiritist country in the world. Spiritism has influenced syncretisms like Brazilian Umbanda and Vietnamese Caodaism . Spiritism is not to be confused with spiritualism . Its use with that meaning is regarded as pejorative by both Spiritualists and Spiritists. Uncapitalised, the word, in English, is an obsolete term for animism and other religious practices involving the invocation of spiritual beings , including shamanism . Spiritual evolution : The philosophical / theological / esoteric idea that nature and human beings and/or human culture evolve along a predetermined cosmological pattern or ascent, or in accordance with certain pre-determined potentials. Predeterminism of evolution concept is also complemented with the idea of a creative impulse of human beings, known as epigenesis . Within this broad definition, theories of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing the development of the individual), or both. They can be holistic (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), idealist (holding that reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or nondual (holding that there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality). All of them can be considered to be teleological to a greater or lesser degree. Spiritualism : May refer to a variety of modern religious ideologies , primarily active in the United States and Europe . Central tenets of Spiritualist liturgy and dogma are the beliefs and practices of mediumship which purports to be evidence of the continued existence of an individual's spirit or soul after death . The origin of Spiritualism is commonly considered to be the Modern Spiritualist movement of the 19th century United States . Spirituality : In a narrow sense, is a concern with matters of the spirit , however that may be defined; but it is also a wide term with many available readings. It may include belief in supernatural powers, as in religion , but the emphasis is on personal experience. It may be an expression for life perceived as higher, more complex or more integrated with one's worldview , as contrasted with the merely sensual. Sufi whirling : The practice of Sufi whirling (or Sufi spinning), is a twirling meditation that originated among the ancient Indian mystics and Turkish Sufis , which is still practiced by the Dervishes of the Mevlevi order. Following a recommended fast of several hours, Sufi whirlers begin with hands crossed onto shoulders and may return their hands to this position if they feel dizzy. They rotate on their left feet in short twists, using the right foot to drive their bodies around the left foot. The left foot is like an anchor to the ground, so that if the whirler loses his or her balance, he or she can think of their left foot, direct attention towards it and regain balance back. Sufism : (Arabic ???? tas?awwuf) A mystic tradition of Islam , which is based on the pursuit of spiritual truth as a definite goal to attain. In modern language it might also be referred to as Islamic spirituality or Islamic mysticism . While fiqh focuses on the legal aspects of Islam, Sufism focuses on the internal aspects of Islam, such as perfecting the aspect of sincerity of faith and fighting one's ego . Sufi practitioners are organized into a diverse range of brotherhoods and sisterhoods, with a wide diversity of thought. Sufi orders ("" tariqas "") can be Shi'a , Sunni , both or neither. Supplication : (also known as petitioning) The most common form of prayer , wherein a person asks a supernatural deity to provide something, either for that person who is praying or for someone else on whose behalf a prayer of supplication is being made. One example of supplication is the Catholic ritual of novena (from novem , the Latin word for ""nine"") wherein one repeatedly asks for the same favor over a period of nine days. This ritual began in France and Spain during the Middle Ages when a nine-day period of hymns and prayers led up to a Christmas feast, a period which ended with gift giving. In Islam , the Arabic word du'a is often used for supplication. Du'a may be made in any language, although there are many traditional Islamic supplications in Arabic, Persian and Turkish . T [ edit ] Tao Te Ching : ( Chinese : ???, Dào dé j?ng ) Roughly translated as The Book of the Way and its Virtue (see article on translating the title) is an ancient Chinese scripture . Tradition has it that the book was written around 600 BCE by a sage called Laozi (WG: Lao Tzu, ""Old Master""), a record-keeper in the Emperor's Court of the Zhou Dynasty . A careful reading of the text, however, suggests that it is a compilation of maxims sharing similar themes. The authenticity of the date of composition/compilation and the authorship are still debated. Tenrikyo : (???; Tenriky? , lit. Teaching of Divine Reason , also known as Tenriism) A religion of Japanese Shinto origin with some Buddhist influence. It was founded by a female peasant, Nakayama Miki , who underwent a revelatory experience from 1838 onwards. After this date she is referred to as Oyasama (lit. Honoured Parent) by followers. Tenrikyo is estimated to have about 2 million followers worldwide with 1.5 million of those in Japan. Theism : The belief in one or more gods or goddesses . More specifically, it may also mean the belief in God, a god, or gods, who is/are actively involved in maintaining the Universe . This secondary meaning is shown in context to other beliefs concerning the divine. The term is attested in English from 1678, and was probably coined to contrast with atheism attested from ca. 1587. Theosis : In Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic theology, theosis, meaning divinization (or woodenly, deification or, to become god ), is the call to man to become holy and seek union with God, beginning in this life and later consummated in the resurrection . Theosis comprehends salvation from sin, is premised upon apostolic and early Christian understanding of the life of faith, and is conceptually foundational in both the East and the West. Tithe : (from Old English teogotha ""tenth"") A one-tenth part of something, paid as a voluntary contribution or as a tax or levy, usually to support a Jewish or Christian religious organization. Today, tithes (or tithing ) are normally voluntary and paid in cash , checks , or stocks , whereas historically tithes could be paid in kind, such as agricultural products. There are still European countries today that allow some churches to assess a mandatory tithe which is enforced by law. Torah : (????) A Hebrew word meaning "" teaching ,"" "" instruction ,"" or "" law ."" It is the central and most important document of Judaism revered by Jews through the ages. It primarily refers to the first section of the Tanakh —the first five books of the Hebrew Bible , but the term is sometimes also used in the general sense to also include both of Judaism's written law and oral law , encompassing the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious teachings throughout history, including the Mishnah , the Talmud , the midrash , and more. Transcendentalism : The name of a group of new ideas in literature , religion , culture , and philosophy that advocates that there is an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through a knowledgeable intuitive awareness that is conditional upon the individual. The concept emerged in New England in the early-to mid-nineteenth century. It is sometimes called "" American Transcendentalism "" to distinguish it from other uses of the word transcendental . It began as a protest against the general state of culture and society at the time, and in particular, the state of intellectualism at Harvard and the doctrine of the Unitarian church which was taught at Harvard Divinity School . U [ edit ] Unitarian Universalism : (UU or UUism) A theologically liberal , inclusive religion formed by the merger of Unitarian and Universalist organizations in the mid-20th century. UUs generally: cherish creativity, freedom, and compassion; embrace diversity and interconnectedness; and promote personal spiritual growth and justice-making through worship, fellowship, personal experience, social action, deeds, and education. While one UU may differ from another in personal creed, the term UU is a distinct theological signifier and Unitarianism or Universalism should not be confused or interchanged with Unitarian Universalism. V [ edit ] Veneration : In traditional Christian churches (for example, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy ), veneration ( Latin veneratio , Greek ?????? dulia ), or veneration of saints, is a special act of honoring a dead person who has been identified as singular in the traditions of the religion, and through them honoring God who made them and in whose image they are made. Veneration is often shown outwardly by respectfully bowing or making the sign of the cross before a saint 's icon , relics , or cult image . These items are often also kissed. Vipassana : (Sanskrit: vipasyan?) The practice of Insight Meditation. While it is often referred to as Buddhist meditation , the practice taught by the Buddha was non-sectarian, and has a universal application. It does not require conversion to Buddhism. While the meditation practices themselves vary from school to school, the underlying principle is the investigation of phenomena (Sanskrit: dharmas ) as they manifest in the five aggregates ( Skandha ) namely, matter or form ( Rupa ), sensation or feelings ( Vedana ), perception ( Samjna ), mental formations ( Sankara ) & consciousness ( Vijnana ). This process leads to direct experiential perception, Vipassan?. W [ edit ] Wabi-sabi : (in Kanji : ??) Represents a comprehensive Japanese world view or aesthetic . It is difficult to explain wabi-sabi in Western terms, but the aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is imperfect, impermanent , or incomplete. A concept derived from the Buddhist assertion of the first noble truth— Dukkha . Worship : Usually refers to specific acts of religious praise, honour, or devotion , typically directed to a supernatural being such as a god or goddess . It is the informal term in English for what sociologists of religion call cultus , the body of practices and traditions that correspond to theology . Religious worship may be performed individually, in informally organized groups, or as part of an organized service with a designated leader (as in a church , synagogue , temple , or mosque ). In its older sense in the English language of worthiness or respect , worship may sometimes refer to actions directed at members of higher social classes (such as lords or monarchs ) or to particularly esteemed persons (such as a lover). Typical acts of worship include: prayer ; sacrifice ( korban in Hebrew); rituals ; meditation ; holidays , festivals ; pilgrimages ; hymns or psalms ; the construction of temples or shrines ; the creation of idols of the deity. Y [ edit ] Yana (Buddhism) : A Sanskrit word with a range of meanings including nouns such as vehicle, journey, and path; and verbs such as going, moving, riding, and marching. In the Indian religions Buddhism and Hinduism, both yana and marga (road or path) express the metaphor of spiritual practice as a path or journey. Ancient texts in both religions discuss doctrines and practices associated with various yanas . In Buddhism, yana often augments the metaphor of the spiritual path with the idea of various vehicles that convey a person along that path. The yana/marga metaphor is similar to the Chinese image of the Tao (path or way) but Indian and Chinese cultures appear to have evolved such similar metaphors independently. Yin and yang : The concept of yin and yang ( Korean : ?? ; Revised : eumyang; McCune–Reischauer : ?myang; simplified Chinese : ?? ; traditional Chinese : ?? ; pinyin : y?nyáng ; Vietnamese : Âm-D??ng ) originates in ancient Chinese philosophy and metaphysics , which describes two primal opposing but complementary forces found in all things in the universe. Yin, the darker element, is passive, dark, feminine, downward-seeking, and corresponds to the night; yang, the brighter element, is active, light, masculine, upward-seeking and corresponds to the day. Yoga : (Sanskrit ???, ""union"") A family of spiritual practices that originated in India, where it is seen primarily as a means to enlightenment (or bodhi ). Traditionally, Karma yoga , Bhakti yoga , Jnana yoga , and R?ja yoga are considered the four main yogas. In the West , yoga has become associated with the asanas (postures) of Hatha yoga , which are popular as fitness exercises. Yoga as a means to enlightenment is central to Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism . Z [ edit ] Zazen : In Zen Buddhism , sitting meditation or zazen ( Japanese : ?? ; literally ""seated concentration"") is a meditative discipline practitioners perform to calm the body and the mind and experience insight into the nature of existence. While the term originally referred to a sitting practice, it is now commonly used to refer to practices in any posture, such as walking.

Skip to Content Taking Charge of Your Health & Wellbeing Enhance your Wellbeing Navigate the Healthcare System Explore Healing Practices Tips for change Health conditions Glossary Our experts About us Pinterest What Is Spirituality? Related Pages What Are Thoughts & Emotions? What Is Life Purpose? Spirituality is a broad concept with room for many perspectives. In general, it includes a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves, and it typically involves a search for meaning in life. As such, it is a universal human experience—something that touches us all. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred or transcendent or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness. Some may find that their spiritual life is intricately linked to their association with a church, temple, mosque, or synagogue. Others may pray or find comfort in a personal relationship with God or a higher power. Still others seek meaning through their connections to nature or art. Like your sense of purpose , your personal definition of spirituality may change throughout your life, adapting to your own experiences and relationships . Spiritual questions For many, spirituality is connected to large questions about life and identity, such as: Am I a good person? What is the meaning of my suffering? What is my connection to the world around me? Do things happen for a reason? How can I live my life in the best way possible? Please share your thoughts on this website so we can improve! Experts’ definitions of spirituality Christina Puchalski, MD, Director of the George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health, contends that ""spirituality is the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred."" According to Mario Beauregard and Denyse O’Leary, researchers and authors of The Spiritual Brain , “spirituality means any experience that is thought to bring the experiencer into contact with the divine (in other words, not just any experience that feels meaningful).” Nurses Ruth Beckmann Murray and Judith Proctor Zenter write that “the spiritual dimension tries to be in harmony with the universe, and strives for answers about the infinite, and comes into focus when the person faces emotional stress, physical illness, or death.” Relationship between religion and spirituality While spirituality may incorporate elements of religion, it is generally a broader concept. Religion and spirituality are not the same thing, nor are they entirely distinct from one another. The best way to understand this is to think of two overlapping circles like this: In spirituality, the questions are: where do I personally find meaning, connection, and value? In religion, the questions are: what is true and right? Where the circles overlap is the individual experience, which affects the way you think, feel, and behave. Spirituality versus emotional health You will notice as you read on that many practices recommended for cultivating spirituality are similar to those recommended for improving emotional wellbeing . This is because there is a connection between the two—emotional and spiritual wellbeing influence one another and overlap, as do all aspects of wellbeing. Spirituality is about seeking a meaningful connection with something bigger than yourself, which can result in positive emotions, such as peace, awe, contentment, gratitude, and acceptance. Emotional health is about cultivating a positive state of mind , which can broaden your outlook to recognize and incorporate a connection to something larger than yourself . Another way of putting it: It is hard to find meaning and connection in life if you are ruminating over negative emotions. Likewise, it can be difficult to cultivate positive emotions, such as gratitude and compassion, if you don’t recognize a larger perspective or sense of interconnectedness in the world. Thus, emotions and spirituality are distinct but linked, deeply integrated with one another. References Beauregard, M., O'Leary, D. (2009). The spiritual brain . New York: Harper Collins.

29," Spirituality in Flux | Spiritual Musclehead Spiritual Musclehead Trying to do all I can to love the Lord with all of who I am and love my neighbor as myself in doing so help mentor and make disciples that transform lives and communities Skip to content Home About Friendship Chapel Christian Reformed Church ? Pressure? Geeky Role Models ? Spirituality in Flux Posted on September 4, 2014 by Josh The world is in flux. Life is in flux. It is fluid and ever moving. Have you ever taken water, poured it into a mug, then into an old Cocoa-Cola bottle, then into a square cup (seen in those art nouveau restaurants that serve little tiny meals and really big prices)? What happens to the water? It changes shape as it shifts from one container to another. Yet the water itself doesn’t change. It’s still made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. On the molecular level, it’s still the same. The only thing that’s changed is what it is containing it. It is literally fluid, ever moving, ever changing, yet always staying the same. That’s the same thing as with the Gospel message (oh, crap, people are going to start being ticked…bear with me, please). The Gospel message is the same. It is the same message given from the very beginning, realized, moved forward, and initiated in Jesus, and continues to move forward in the world. Yet at the same time it is translated, changing shape but never changing content. It is translated into so many different languages. Not just into the language itself, but into the culture itself. The container it is in is different but the actual message is the same. Even though the message is the same as it changes containers, spirituality itself is in flux. And this is weird to tell the truth. For years, people didn’t want to be spiritual. After so many wars in the 16th and 17th century, people wanted to be rational, logical people, not spiritual. And so logic and reason prevailed in the western world. Until some odd years ago when people rediscovered spirituality. And more so rediscovered true spirituality–the Gospel Message of life in Jesus, new spiritual life and vitality in Jesus. He’s always been there. He’s always been with us. He’s always offered us spiritual life and vitality. Yet instead of approaching Jesus in a spiritual heartfelt vein, he was approached through logic and reason in an attempt to make him fit into a container he was never meant to fit into. And in doing so, he over spilled into the world around us. Today there is a hunger for spiritual things. Spirituality is in flux. We as a people yearn and hunger for spiritual things, for meaning of life, the universe, and everything (and no, the actual answer isn’t 42). In searching for true spirituality, we search for peace. We search for a peace that calms the soul and heart. Jesus offers true spirituality when our spirituality is in flux. Jesus says to his disciples when they are in flux, seeking and worrying “ Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid .” John 14:27 Later on in the letters of Paul, Paul writes about how the peace of God, the peace of Jesus is tied up in prayer and thankfulness. “ Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .” Philippians 4:6-7 We seek peace when things are in flux. We seek peace when things are ever changing. This peace that is offered isn’t your normal peace. To us today peace means an absence of conflict. That’s not what true peace is. The word for peace in the Old Testament is shalom. It means more than just peace. It means the knowledge, understanding, and feeling of closeness with God as it was supposed to be in the Garden of Eden. That is the peace that Jesus gives to his disciples and to us. That is the peace which transcends all understanding and guards our hearts and minds that is given to us when we come to God in Jesus’ name laying with thanksgiving all our anxieties in prayer before him. We are spiritual people. We seek out the spiritual, now more than ever. Yet we seek it out in was that aren’t effective. We think that the message of life, of new spiritual life, found in Jesus can be placed anywhere and can take on any molecular form. Mercury is also found in liquid form. It can be poured into different containers and change it’s outwards shape but still contain its molecular make up. Mercury is poisonous and can lead to death. Water gives life. Jesus is the living water which gives us a new spiritual life ( John 4:10 ). Spirituality is in flux. Do you want to truly be a real spiritual person? Do you desire to be spiritually alive? It is more than just trying out the smorgasbord of spirituality that is around us where you pick and choose what you want to believe in and go back for seconds when you’re done with it. It is living the Gospel and Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, lives in you, making you truly spiritually alive. When this happens, spirituality is no longer in flux, but alive, moving, fluid, and real. Are you spiritually in flux right now? Do you want stability? There is true stability and spiritual life and vitality ready and waiting. Will you stay in flux?

(RNS/Wesley Theological Seminary) Adelle M. Banks | Dec. 3, 2016 Print email PDF Washington Anna Schalk finds herself weeping each time she enters an Orthodox church and gazes at the flat, colorful icons of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. The impressionistic painter had long been drawn to spiritual images but this year she took a big step beyond her own artistic and religious traditions. At a summer workshop, she created an icon of her own, alongside other students who spent a week together with the same mission. “It’s like a meditative experience,” said the retired pediatric occupational therapist, a Roman Catholic, comparing her work on the icon to partaking in Communion. “When I receive the host, it’s similar.” Schalk, of Alexandria, Va., is part of a growing multifaith movement of people who have been drawn to the art and the spirituality of iconography, taking short-term classes with experts, who often travel from abroad to lead U.S. students in the craft they say is more about seeking the divine than painting an image. View the NCR Christmas Gift Guide in time for the holiday season! In fact, experts say icons are “written,” rather than painted. Theodoros Papadopoulos, who traveled from Greece to teach the class, recounted in the first day’s lesson the history and meaning of iconography. “The Byzantine Orthodox iconography is not just an ‘art,’ it’s a sacred art,” he said. “It is not ‘painting,’ it’s theology. It is not ‘artistic expression,’ it is expectation of salvation.” David Morgan, a religion scholar and art historian at Duke University, said the iconography tradition, which dates to the early centuries of Christianity, is designed to be distinct from more naturalistic art, which became more common in the Renaissance period. The flatness of the image, its stillness, the large eyes of its figures and the often symmetrical style are all intentional ways of distinguishing between the ordinary world and a heavenly realm. “The two-dimensional image denies three-dimensional presence,” he said. “It says the spirit is not about three dimensions. It’s about a reality that is revealed in the image, revealed in the holy Scriptures, revealed in the sacrament, and it’s something that one needs to recognize as very special.” The artistic process taught in iconography classes is bathed in prayer, both individual and corporate. Before his history lesson, Papadopoulos began the workshop Schalk attended with an iconographer’s prayer. It was printed on a sheet for the students to read together before picking up their paintbrushes to “write” an image of the Christ child embracing his mother. “Lord Jesus Christ, God of all, enlighten us, imbue the soul, the heart, the intellect of Your servant,” they prayed, standing before easels in a bright, window-filled room steps away from the sanctuary of St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral. Experts say the growth in interest — and diversity of religions involved — has been building over the last couple of decades. Lynette Hull, an iconographer with the Prosopon School of Iconology, a “school without walls” that offers iconography classes, said a six-day intensive course was started by school founder and Russian native Vladislav Andrejev 28 years ago. Hull, a Presbyterian convert to Orthodoxy, thinks icons are attractive to people in an age that is more secular and more image-driven than the past. “Every person sees hundreds of images a day and the icon is beginning to speak to people in a way that it hasn’t before,” Hull said. “Not everybody who takes the class converts to Orthodoxy. However, it does speak to and lead people into a spiritual journey.” Within weeks of the St. Sophia class, which was held for its second year, Wesley Theological Seminary, a United Methodist-affiliated school a mile and a half away, also held an iconography class taught by Philip Davydov, a Russian iconographer. “We mostly do this in some circles which are non-Orthodox,” Davydov said of the workshops that are limited to 14 people, allowing time for enough one-on-one interaction with each student. “Iconography is a special way to approach God and a special way to create instruments for others to approach God,” he said. In the class at St. Sophia, students often kept their voices low during brief interviews about their experience, so as not to disturb others who were creating their icons. Some say the process helps them to become more patient while others say it motivates them to concentrate on the needs of others. “To me it’s a prayer,” said Lara Neri, an artist and Byzantine Catholic from Dallas, of the dozens of hours spent in the class. “It’s probably the most intense prayer that I do.” She prayed for friends whom she had emailed in advance to ask if they had specific requests. “While I’m painting, I’m praying to commit them and their needs to the heart of Mary and Jesus,” she said. Hundreds of these intensive classes, which Hull said often cost from $500 to $800, are held across the country. She estimated that the Prosopon School’s Andrejev alone has taught more than 5,000 students in 25 years. Hull said when she has traveled to Russia, she has been met with some opposition to the notion of teaching non-Orthodox students about iconography. “It tends to be people from outside of American culture who are more worried about it,” she said. “For the Orthodox, the icon is a really holy thing and if you’re not Orthodox how can you make an icon?” “To me it’s a prayer,” said Lara Neri, an artist and Byzantine Catholic from Dallas. “It’s probably the most intense prayer that I do.” But experts in the U.S. say the broad interest is often welcomed. “There is nothing wrong with a non-Orthodox person wanting to learn iconography for their own spiritual discipline,” said the Rev. Aristidis Garinis, an iconographer and a priest serving at the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas in Flushing, N.Y. Iconographers, on the other hand, should be Orthodox church members designated by the church, he said. During the St. Sophia class, Papadopoulos guided his students in the basics of Byzantine icons, contrasting them with other forms of art. There is only height and width and no depth. Images of Jesus are larger than other figures because he is the most holy, he explained. Gradually over the week, his charges added the blue background and the bright gold paint of the haloes surrounding the heads of Mary and baby Jesus, using egg tempera paints Papadopoulos mixed at the front of the room with eggs he deftly separated. Some of the students came with artistic experience, hungry to learn more. Emmanuel “Chito” Santos traveled all the way from Guam, after seeing a notice about the class online. He teaches geography and art at a Catholic boys prep school but also has filled its chapel’s walls with art of apostles and saints. “I have to learn and I have to unlearn a few things that I assumed was the right way to do it,” he said of his new work with an expert. But unlike some students, Santos was already familiar with the icon that Papadopoulos chose for the class: Our Lady of Vladimir. The instructor from Guam says it offers a gentle evangelistic direction. “There’s a message through it, you see,” he said, pausing at his easel. “She looks at you so she’s talking to you but then she’s holding on to her baby so then the message is ‘Follow my baby.’ And then the baby is looking at her face and so the message of the baby is ‘Follow my mom. My mom is the best example of how to follow me.’” Orthodox Catholic Church Theodoros Papadopoulos Christian iconography Advertisement Print email PDF Show comments National Catholic Reporter uses Civil Comments.

Seated among religious scholars, monks, nuns and high-profile dignitaries at the Yid-Gha-Choezin Gompa, which faces the stadium, Dorje bestowed ‘lifelong empowerment of Buddha Amityas to all sentient beings’ on Tuesday, an official release said here. The Karmapa urged his audience to practise compassion and also spoke on the relationship between earlier Karmapas and the Monpas of Tawang. Dorje, who is revered by a large section of Tibetan Buddhists as the head of the Karma Kagyu sect of Buddhism, visited Tawang for the first time on Monday. The spiritual leader, whose identification as the 17th Karmapa and escape from Tibet to India have both been subject of controversy, was accompanied by adviser to the Union home minister, Amitabh Mathur. The visit of Dorje is significant as Arunachal is claimed by China as part of its territory. Tawang, home to a sizeable Tibetan Buddhist community, was one of the flashpoints of the India-China war of 1962. The presence of US ambassador to India Richard Verma at the recently concluded Tawang Festival had also provoked a sharp response from China. The visit also assumes significance as the Centre had previously imposed several restrictions on Dorje’s movements, especially proposed trips to areas of strategic importance like Lahaul and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh. On Monday, however, the spiritual leader was welcomed by Arunachal chief minister Pema Khandu at the Guwahati airport. They then flew to the Tawang monastery where Dorje advised people to have faith in the teachings of The Buddha and The Dalai Lama. He also urged the Sanghas to be united to prevent ‘outside forces’ from hampering the progress of Buddhism in the region. Dorje, who serves as spiritual guide to millions of Buddhists around the world, interacted with locals who lined up along the road to the monastery with ‘khada’, incense sticks and flowers to welcome him. Upon his arrival at Tawang, Dorje visited the Sera-Jae-Jamyang Choekorling monastery and attended certain rituals there. He then went to the Sangyeling monastery from where he made his way to the Tawang Monastery. He took part in rituals there too and watched monks performing the Lhamu Tsokhar and Durda dances. The Karmapa expressed gratitude for the welcome accorded to him and said he was fortunate to have visited Tawang. He thanked Khandu and Union MoS for home affairs, Kiren Rijiju, for planning his visit. Khandu, too, thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Rajnath Singh for allowing the Karmapa to visit Arunachal. He also thanked Rijiju for clearing the necessary formalities. Spiritual vibrancy, clean village tanks on Dharmasthala’s radar 29 Nov 2016, 22:54 Mangaluru: Come February 2017 and Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP) will associate itself actively in the cleanup and maintenance of 100 village tanks in rain deficient districts of north Karnataka. This was announced by D Veerendra Heggade, dharmahikari, Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala at the 84th session of ‘sarvadharma sammelan’ organized by the Kshetra as part of the annual Lakshadeepotsava celebration on Sunday. L H Manjunath, executive director, SKDRDP, told TOI that village tanks are the primary source of drinking water for residents of many districts in north Karnataka. However, water in most of these tanks is dirty and the surface water is usually contaminated, making them unfit for human use. Compounding woes of villagers is the fact that these tanks run dry towards the end of January and early February, leaving them exposed to a long waterless summer, he said. This happens due to lack of periodic upkeep and cleaning of tanks, Manjunath explained post cleaning and rejuvenation, steps will be taken to ensure rain water is stored in it during monsoon. Describing the project envisaged by SKDRDP as purely a watershed activity, Manjunath said it also involves creating awareness among villagers to keep their respective drinking water source clean and the project will be implemented in 100 tanks in north Karnataka districts. “We have set aside Rs 10 crore for the project,” he said adding the activity taken up in 10 village tanks in Kalaburagi and Dharwad earlier this year at a cost of Rs 30 lakh was an outstanding success. The villagers with their active and direct involvement ensure that funds allocated by the Kshetra was not wasted, he said adding this is where government sponsored projects of similar nature fail. “The focus was on repair, rejuvenation and maintenance of tanks,” he noted. Clean temples for spiritual vibrancy The other important announcement that Heggade made was to ensure cleanliness of sanctum-sanctorum, gopura as well as that of internal and external premises of temples in Karnataka before Makara Sankranti next year. Members of 18,000-odd SHGs functioning under SKDRDP will associate with local voluntary organisations in this onerous task, Heggade told TOI, adding he conceptualized on this idea just two-days back and minute details need to be worked out. Aim of this is to ensure spiritual vibrancy in temples dotting the state and will involve bringing on board the temple managements, the administrators, priest and the devotees. The programme has a spiritual and religious background to it, Heggade said adding taluk wise list of temples will be prepared before the programme is rolled out on ground. “We will explain the need for this endeavour to the volunteers and how they should go about it after detailed planning,” he said. The announcement was also spurred by an added sense of responsibility cast on the Kshetra, which as per a survey carried out by an English magazine, was adjudged cleanest temple town in India, Heggade said. “We spend lakhs on temple festival, be it on electrification, decoration and other aspects, but only a small part on cleanliness,” he said adding the Kshetra outsources this task to a dedicated group who ensure that the temple premises is clean during Lakshadeepotsava. Cleanliness is a mindset and cleanliness of temples with focus on hygiene and purity should become a priority, Heggade said adding the fine print of this scheme will be made public in the next 15-days. Admitting that the deadline of January 14, 2017 for this task is cutting it a little close, Heggade said there is a religious significance in choosing Makara Sankranti as it also marks transition from dakshinayana to uttarayan that heralds arrival of spring season.

An abrupt end to spiritual journey for Admanes 23 Nov 2016 NAGPUR: Arun Admane and his wife Padma, the couple in the worst-affected S2 coach of ill-fated Indore-Patna express that met with an accident last week, wanted to reach most shrines across the country before finally putting their travelling shoes away. Nagpur’s Admanes, among the 150 killed in one of country’s worst train mishaps, did not know this journey would be their last. On Tuesday, their last rites were performed in city. Having already visited Omkareshwar and Ujjain, the Admane couple had boarded the Patna-bound train on Saturday from Indore with a plan to visit Kashi but the journey was abruptly truncated at Pukhrayan following a derailment. The couple had begun their marital journey more than 35 years ago. They died almost together with only the distance between two berths, 41 and 44, separating them in the coach that had turned into a mangled heap of steel in the mishap. Arun, a former lecturer with Seva Sadan DEd college on Ambazari road, intriguingly, had anticipated just such an end just in the summer when they were heading to Kedarnath. Such strong was the inner feeling of an unfinished journey to Kedarnath that Arun summoned his sons, Vishal and Pankaj, to tell them of important documents, policies and records that would be required for various settlements if they were to pass away. That time Admanes had to abandon their journey half way and return as it was Arun’s brother who passed away. Vishal, the elder son of Admane couple, said their desire to visit Kedarnath has remained incomplete now. “Father was keen to visit Kedarnath but we suggested that he do it next summer. We did not know such an occasion would never come again,” he said. It was Vishal’s wife Natasha who saw the news on TV and began enquiring about the well-being of her in-laws. “I knew they were on a pilgrimage but did not know the train they were taking. We casually called to find out how they were. My father-in-law’s mobile phone was ringing while mother-in-law’s was switched off. After a couple of attempts, a police officer picked up my call and relayed the unthinkable news,” she said. Vishal added, “My mother was religious from the start but later father too started embracing it. The initial tours were to realize my mother’s dreams to go to all pilgrimages but later he too got spiritually inclined.” Natasha and her sister-in-law Vaishali said their late father-in-law was an expert in drawing up itineraries as he had organized several college tours in the past. “Mother-in-law’s name was in the list of the injured and so we all hoped,” said Natasha. The family, which brought the bodies to city in an ambulance from Akbarpura in Kanpur dehat district, had to toil for Padma’s body which was shifted to a grain cold storage after being labelled ‘unidentified’. After visiting several hospitals, hoping to see her alive, the family finally came across the body kept in the cold storage. A melange of spirituality and feasting 18 Nov 2016 When entrepreneur Nita Singh organised a luncheon and prasad at her home to celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti recently, many of her glam friends were in attendance to partake the special delicacies that tasted divine. Nita, who made the prasad along with her family members, said, “Nanak bhoosriyan pakaiyaan, paiyaan thaale Mahe. Jeeni guru manaye, raj raj sayee khaye.’ These dishes were made with a lot of spiritual passion and that reflects in the taste. It also gave me an opportunity to catch up with my dear friends, who added colour to Gurpurab festivities.” A melange of spirituality and feasting 18 Nov 2016 When entrepreneur Nita Singh organised a luncheon and prasad at her home to celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti recently, many of her glam friends were in attendance to partake the special delicacies that tasted divine.

The introspection and what followed shaped the man within. This week, Yugpurush, a theatre production that celebrated the association and conversations between Gandhi and Jain poet-philosopher Shrimad Rajchandra, dwelt upon this. A 4,000-strong audience, all donning white, sat on a floor to watch a play that marks the 150th birth anniversary of Rajchandra, their spiritual guru, who was born as Raichandbhai Mehta and attained fame as a scholar of Jainism. Playing out chapter 25 from the autobiography, a faint ‘Vaishnavajan To Tene Kahiye’ plays in the background as the curtains open to a young, brash Mohandas who returns as barrister from London on July 6, 1891. The act progresses to show how the Jain scholar’s advice shaped Mohandas’s thinking. The spiritual relationship culminates in the making of the Mahatma. “The birth and life of the Great Ones are worth remembering. They awaken our latent strength and kindle the desire to become like them,” said Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai, founder of the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur, which put together the play. Several phases of interaction between Gandhi and Rajchandra from 1891 to 1893 are enacted before the former left for South Africa. The stage then transports the audience to Durban and back to India as they continued their correspondence till Rajch-andra died on April 9, 1901. They are said to have exchanged over 200 letters in this per-iod. In an article written in Yerwada Centr-al Jail, Gandhi said, “We are all worldy people whereas Shrimad was not of this world. We will have to take many births whereas for Shrimad perhaps one birth is sufficient. We will perhaps be running away from liberation, whereas Shrimad was advancing towards liberation at a very fast pace”. Gandhi’s proclamation of Rajchandra as his spiritual mentor came later. “In my moments of spiritual crisis, Shrimadji was my refuge,” he wrote in The Story of My Experiments with Truth. In the Modern Review, June 1930, he said, “Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now.” About 50-odd shows have opened for booking till December and are seeing people queuing up in large numbers. The play will travel around the world and will be translated in Hindi, English and other Indian languages. Tushar Gandhi who was present for the opening show, said he was glad that someone had finally looked at this chapter of his great-grandfather’s life. “What is important for me is the humility that Shrimadji instilled in Bapu,” he said. Spiritual spaces 6 Nov 2016 For years the puja ghar has been an Indian home staple but now it’s all about integrating spirituality into your daily décor Spiritual tourism hotspot: Magh Mela to attract Thai tourists 5 Nov 2016 Allahabad: If all goes as per plan, the annual month-long religious fair of Magh Mela organised at the banks of Sangam, would become a ‘spiritual tourism’ hotspot for thousands of Buddhists coming from Thailand. To boost revenue, the state government is keen on attracting as many as 80,000 tourists visiting Buddhist Circuit to Magh Mela, said officials. A one-man delegation, comprising the district magistrate, was in Thailand to talk to official tour operators and government departments, in this regard. The Thai officials, who claimed to have heard about Magh Mela for the first time, have decided to send a team during this year's fair to judge the scope of tourism, climate and geographical location of the city, said DM Sanjay Kumar, who recently returned from Thailand. District magistrate Sanjay Prasad said, “Kumbh and ardh-Kumbh held every 12 years and six years, respectively, attracts tourists from across the globe. But during the Magh Mela, the number of foreign tourists fail to cross the double digit mark, even on important bathing days.” Prasad said that after the meeting, it has been planned to change the route of Buddhist Circuit during the Magh Mela. We want them to incorporate Allahabad in their route so that thousands of foreign tourists can be brought to the mela. “There are plans to include Sangam city on the Varanasi to Kushinagar route of Buddhist Circuit. Changes will be made after the team visiting the Magh Mela completes the formalities,” he added. Lakhs of seers and devotees camp at the banks of Sangam during the month-long Magh Mela. The devotees also observe fast during the camping period called ‘kalpwas’. A mini-mela administration , police lines, ration shops, fire department and a chain of hospitals are set up along the banks during the same period to cater to the devotees. This year, the mela would be held in December-January.

Delhi govt to develop spiritual garden along river Yamuna 25 Oct 2016 NEW DELHI: Delhi government will be developing a spiritual/religious garden at the Geeta Ghat along River Yamuna where it held a maha aarti last year on the occasion of Bhai Dooj. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will also unveil a Yamuna riverfront development plan for a 5-km long stretch on November 1. “The work for developing the ‘Nakshatra Garden’, based on Hindu mythology, has been started. Delhi Jal Board’s horticulture department is planting trees and shrubs in line with the 27 constellations and nine planets. A tulsi vrindavan will also be developed here,” said DJB chairperson Kapil Mishra. The government will spend Rs 25 lakh on development of this garden. Since work is taking place at this ghat, the aarti this year has been shifted to the Sonia Vihar ghat and will take place on November 1. “This year we are expecting close to 10,000 people to attend the aarti. We will also host artists from Gujarat and organize a cultural function that day,” said Mishra. The government’s Yamuna riverfront development plan is also ready and will be unveiled on November 1. Mishra said that for the time being, 5-km of the Yamuna’s 22-km stretch through Delhi, will be taken up for work. While this land belongs to DDA, Delhi government will undertake the work and also finance it. “The plan includes creation of wetlands, natural trails, an international standard rowing and canoeing facility, aarti ghat etc. Nothing will be made of concrete and we will only use bamboo and other natural material for construction. The work will be done in three phases and will be completed in about a year and a half. The first phase will be completed by June next year. An approximate expenditure of Rs 200 crore is expected on this project,” said Mishra.

BJP: Develop spiritual tourism as an industry 27 Sep 2016 he state BJP on Monday maintained that spiritual tourism has a huge potential for growth as industry in the state, but the Nitish Kumar government has neglected it. Develop spiritual tourism as an industry: BJP 26 Sep 2016 Patna: The state BJP on Monday maintained that spiritual tourism has a huge potential for growth as industry in the state, but the Nitish Kumar government has neglected it. The party demanded preparation of a roadmap for the promotion and growth of spiritual tourism in the state. Former minister and BJP functionary Jamshed Ashraf said tourism and agriculture are the only sectors in the state with an immense scope for growth. “If the state’s tourism sector is brought on the national map, it would yield huge revenue returns,” he added. “From my experience of over 10 years, I can say that the state lacks roadmap for the growth of tourism industry, despite the fact that spiritual tourism has the potential to attract a large number of foreign and domestic tourists. Promotion and growth of tourism cannot be tapped and achieved without a well-planned roadmap,” he added. Ashraf said Bihar has immense advantage over other states in the country in spiritual tourism, as two major religions – Buddhism and Jainism – were born in the state and it has also been the birthplace of the 10th and last guru of the Sikhs – Guru Govind Singh. “While Buddhism is the fourth largest religion in the world in terms of population, followers of Jainism and Sikhism have big economic advantage,” Ashraf said, adding that several places associated with the three religions are in Bihar. “Although the state government conceived the idea of developing tourist circuits like Sita Circuit, Ramayan Circuit and Sufi Circuit, no concrete attempt has yet been made to put them on the national map,” Ashraf said. Ashraf added that CM Nitish Kumar recently referred to the scope of growth of the state’s spiritual tourism, but what he said sounded more like “platitude” than a real concern, since its promotion would require long-term strategy.

It provides techniques to unite the body, mind and breath, and connect to the inner core of our being – the spiritual aspect of our lives. Still Yourself & Shape Up With Yoga Postures Begin Your Inner Journey Now! Get on to the yoga mat, your launch pad for a journey of inner discovery Take your seat - making it steady and comfortable with yoga poses (no seat belt is required, when you are so stable!) Breathe easy for takeoff – breathe in, breathe out and calm your mind with pranayamas And just glide into meditation ... Ask yourself: Do trivial things easily throw you off balance? Are you confused? Is your mind in conflict? The mind often oscillates between the past and future, causing worry and anticipation. Desires, fear, cravings, aversions grip the mind. To drop the conflicts in the mind, it is essential to bring the mind to the present moment. Yoga cleanses the body and mind of accumulated stress and negative impressions. Pranayamas calm down the agitated mind. With regular practice of yoga poses , you will see that clarity dawns right away, body balance and flexibility improves, and makes you healthy, strong and alert. Yoga & Meditation Maintains Inner & Outer Harmony What's more - the balance, flexibility, alertness that you achieve on the yoga mat, reflects in your actions and attitude off the yoga mat too. Learning to breathe through difficult postures can help you breathe through difficult times. Stretching in the yoga poses to your limit without comparing with another, can lead to an attitude to do your best in a situation and let go. This attitude helps in overcoming stress. Being physically flexible leads to mental flexibility. At the same time, being mentally flexible (for example: 'I can do it' attitude) leads to physical flexibility. ""The word yoga means skill - skill to live your life, to manage your mind, to deal with your emotions, to be with people, to be in love and not let that love turn into hatred."" - Sri Sri Ravi Shankar How can we obtain this skill? Spirituality Gives Inner Strength ""For me, spirituality is all about living a happier life 'in the moment', responding to situations rather than reacting, de-programming and connecting with my Self to come with a fresh response to situations that repeat. Yoga and meditation give me just that!"" shares Sylaja Kannan, an IT professional from Bangalore, India. The practice of yoga and meditation prove to be a powerful combination and many enthusiasts like to round their yoga routine with a meditation. When the wobbling body becomes steadier and the disturbed mind becomes calmer, meditation can provide a deep sense of relaxation. Spirituality gives inner strength to manage difficult situations and to keep smiling. Being established in the Self, your inner peace spreads outward, and makes you a more responsible human being full of caring, sharing and love. In sleep you get rid of fatigue, but the deeper stresses remain in your body. Meditation, yoga, and Sudarshan Kriya cleanses even the deepest layers of your consciousness, leaving you rested and refreshed. Deepen Your Yoga Practice And Soar With Your Spirit Do you find that you can smile in any situation? Do you recognize that something deep in you is non-changing? Deepen your yoga practice and experience the joy that you are. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar says, ""The truth about ourselves and our lives need to be updated. We need to revisit them and ask ourselves these questions again and again, 'What do I want?' 'Am I doing the right thing?' 'Am I happy?' Spirituality is not just some mumbo jumbo, sitting somewhere and doing something. It is revisiting the truth about ourselves..."" - Written by Daya Krishnan with inputs from Shriram Sarvotham, who has been a yoga enthusiast from a very young age. Interested in yoga classes?

35," The Spiritual Warrior – Learning Through Adversity | Dr Akilah - Celestial Healing Wellness Center Home Our Wellness Center Links Disclaimer Dr Akilah – Celestial Healing Wellness Center The Natural Health and Holistic World According to Dr Akilah The Spiritual Warrior – Learning Through Adversity Leave a comment Posted by docakilah on June 8, 2012 By Chris Bourne I’ve faced many challenging and difficult situations in my life. It seems prior to awakening, my life was nothing but struggle through adversity: continually confronting and overcoming challenges. Since awakening, many things have changed. I’ve learned the art of divinely surrendering to the flow. Of accepting life as it really is. Has this made life any easier? Not at all! I love the complexity, challenge and opportunities in life; the chance to learn and grow. Overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles is what stirs our blood. Whether man or woman, cultivating the warrior spirit can be of great service to us all… The divine blend Frequently there seems to be a view in spiritual circles that the path to Enlightenment is one of softness, gentleness and light; that unconditional love is only expressed through the softness of the divine feminine. This is an illusion! The soul has seven key characteristics, only one of which, is the surrenderedness of the divine feminine. (see… Seven Rays of Divine Impulse ). The masculine warrior energy is the counterpart to the softness of the divine feminine and in truth, both sexes need it. It is just as vital for creativity and without it, we probably wouldn’t do anything effective at all. To be truly enlightened, is to be able to unleash, and allow to flow, all of the authentic characteristics of our soul, without limitation, control or hesitation. Of course the warrior has gained much negative connotation in life because of the distortions of it. Its energy has been used through the ages to gain power over people, to control and imprison them. This is a gross distortion of the energy, the purpose of which is to invigorate, uplift and liberate. It is to breakdown lower harmonies yes, but not to create some other limiting status quo. Rather it is to continually provide new possibilities for growth and advancement. This authentic yearning is in everyone of us, male and female alike, and to deny it is to deny who we are. Invoking the spiritual warrior energy If we truly want to be fulfilled in life, it is going to involve us learning to work with our warrior energy. For those who do not frequently feel the arising of this powerfully passionate and creative yearning, it might mean invoking the warrior energy by doing things that activate adrenaline. It could be taking part in sports like the martial arts for example. If you’re young and fit, it could be something like mountain climbing. If we’re older and less agile, that needn’t stop us, a power walk in nature might be for you. Anything to get the lungs and heart pumping. Maybe watching emotive films would help – films like “Lord of the Rings” and “The Matrix” for example. Once the energy is flowing, you’ll definitely feel it! It’s the kind of energy that wants you to jump and leap; to scream and shout. When you feel it arising, the key is not to deny it, but to find a positive vehicle for its expression. Letting the energy come through, but in a harnessed way. We need to ‘open the internal pipe’ through which it is channeled by feeling it and working with it. Denial is dangerous You may feel the pipe too constricted within you and it may cause you initially to tighten as it flows. That’s when the warrior energy turns into frustration and anger. If this happens, keep working with it. Work with people who’ll let you be who you are without judgment. When it happens to the friends in my life, I get them to don boxing gloves and spar (either with me or a punch bag). It’s simply amazing how liberating and enlivening it can be! The key is not to suppress the warrior energy or try to make it dissolve before you are ready; denial is dangerous because the energy simply goes inside leading to repression, deep seated frustration and stress. Keep finding the appropriate vehicle. We will each have a way appropriate for our lives and when we’ve discovered how to harness the energy, we become more at ease with it. We don’t tighten when it arises, we don’t get angry or frustrated and we certainly don’t use it to control or intimidate people. Arising anger is directed positively rather than at people. In so doing, it becomes a powerfully creative force for good in our lives. It gives us the courage to surmount the seemingly insurmountable. In these often chaotic times of great change and challenge, it is the energy that can break down the limiting constrictions of the past and unleash positive force for growth. It is this energy that can open the breathing space for a higher harmony to emerge. Tips on harnessing the spiritual warrior energy Here are some tips gained from working with people on how to harness the spiritual warrior in you: Invoke it: if you have trouble raising the warrior in you and you feel any strongly creative and manifesting juices are lacking, then watch for the subtle rising of passion and bring attention to it. It could be something as simple as dancing in the rain or it could be getting up early and power walking to the sound of the dawn chorus. Or it could be dancing passionately to your favourite boogie box tunes. Whatever generates that feeling of empowered invigoration Unleash it: denial is not a river in Egypt! If we try the ‘spiritual identity’ approach and put on the ‘Buddha-like-behaviour’ if it’s not how we’re truly feeling, then we’ll build either deep seated frustration or bubbling anger. Better to find a way of letting it out, but without directing it at anyone – unless they’re a willing facilitator Contain it: if the energy is running strongly through your ‘veins’, then building and holding it, so as not to let dissipate too soon will be of benefit. The key is not to get lost in it. Not to let it control you. Feel it, but then contain it within your consciousness. It’s something that comes from experience. Channel it: once the warrior energy is there, the key is to watch for productive and constructive ways to channel it. If you’re holding it within you, those opportunities are bound to materialise as a product of your conciousness. It could be through physical exercise, but it could also be some for of challenging action that requires commitment and courage – confronting a friend, relative or acquaintance with naturally arising confrontational news for example. It could be through the creative arts or caringly passionate sexual intercourse. Master it: the warrior spirit is one that requires much attention and care in its mastery. It is influenced, suppressed or harnessed through many of our daily activities from the food we eat to the colour of the clothes we wear. Of course it’s gotten pretty bad ‘press’ through the course of history, but make no mistake, those that work to harness it in a productive way will find it works creatively for you through the daily events of your life. For more info, refer to this popular article… Healing the Wounded Dragon In the eyes of the Spiritual Warrior You know when you’re looking into the eyes of a spiritual warrior. They’re eyes that have seen it all: the pleasure and the pain, the success and the heartache. They’ve been broken and bowed by it all, yet they didn’t stop, they didn’t give in. When you look into the eyes of a spiritual warrior, you see eons of earth shattering experience, humbly expressed through an immovable sense of self belief and presence. It’s definitely not something that arises overnight or simply springs up without courageously clearing the path before it. It is one that arises from patience and persistence. Something, that at a soul level, we each carry in abundance. About the Author At the age of 40 Chris was involved in a life threatening car crash in which he thought he would certainly die. This precipitated total inner surrender and a rapid reconnection with the conscious life force through all things. He found himself suddenly able to experience and contemplate through multiple dimensions of reality to see the deeper purpose of life itself. He began to remember his true reason for being here. He explains… “During the crash, time seemed to slow right down and I was guided back through key moments of my life. I was realising that every moment in our lives has but one underlying purpose – to reveal an aspect of truth about ourselves to ourselves. I was beginning to dissolve every belief and value our society had conditioned within me.” “This was my initial awakening to the magical unifying consciousness of the soul. Over the eight years that followed, I was guided through four other inner ‘Gateways’ of consciousness. I have since come to know the process as the five key expansions on our journey of Enlightenment and ultimate Ascension into multi dimensional living – our divine birthright”. Prior to the crash, Chris had a rich an varied professional career in industry, in teaching, as an Officer in the Army and finally as a web development entrepreneur before being initiated on his spiritual path. With a Masters Degree in Natural Sciences from Oxford University, participants in the work are finding his integration of grounded scientific understanding and profound spiritual realisation deeply engaging and transformative.

Credit: Josh Fox Meet the Standing Rock Spiritual Leader Helping Activists Find Their 'Inner Warrior' By Josh Fox 1 day ago More News Facing Violence, Standing Rock Protesters Hold Thanksgiving Action Kate Nash Enlists Green Day, Radiohead, More for Standing Rock Protest Lamb of God's Randy Blythe: My Trip to Standing Rock All Stories One of the spiritual leaders of Standing Rock is Doug Good Feather, the great-grand-nephew of Sitting Bull and a two-tour Iraq War veteran – he's headed back to Standing Rock this weekend with a group of 2,000 veterans to help protect and support protesters who've spent months resisting the Dakota Access Pipeline. Good Feather is also the founder and executive director of the Lakota Way Healing Center in Denver, which helps people dealing with PTSD, addiction issues, homelessness and general trauma and depression through Native American ceremony. Good Feather treats Native American spirituality as a healing force. ""After I got back from Iraq, I didn't know if I wanted to live. I went through all of these things: addiction, homelessness, suicidal thoughts. Now I help people get through them through ceremony,"" he says. Related Watch Shailene Woodley's Standing Rock Plea to President Obama ""I ask and I pray"" that the Obama administration will stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, says the 'Divergent' star After the Thanksgiving Day showdown at Turtle Island – during which Native water protectors bravely ignored the demands of many heavily armed police to hold a peaceful ceremony honoring their ancestors – Good Feather summons some of us from the front lines of the action to one of the camp's two sweat lodges. Doug Pineda, another Native purveyor of spiritual wisdom and a relative of Good Feather's, explains its core values. ""In our sweat lodge, we use the elements stone, earth, water, air. We are connected to the earth. We are connected to the water. … We are connected to the earth. We live with the earth. The more we are connected, the more spiritual we are. It is that straightforward at its core,"" he says. Of the greater camp and movement at Standing Rock, Good Feather says, ""This is the beginning of the healing from the addiction – the addiction to oil, the addiction to consumerism, the addiction to that lifestyle which leaves you strung out, feeling miserable and lonely."" He adds, ""We find our inner warrior again. All kinds of warriors exist; this is the warrior that we find of peace. If we don't cure our addiction to this – to oil – nothing will matter in the future."" ""People find out here that we don't need much to live. When we strip things away, we're happier,"" says Good Feather. ""We need the elements, we need the wood, we need the water. … When we purchase a plastic cup, we're just paying the oil industry and the Dakota Access Pipeline more money."" About 20 of us are gathered by a fire, where lava rocks are heating up. Good Feather says, ""I'm not a medicine man. I'm not here to convert anyone. I do want to open this ceremony up to you so we can pray and go through it together."" I feel reassured in his presence, his calm voice and his groundedness allowing me to safe, innocent and curious. The fire around the lava stones lasts for several hours, making them white-hot. When Good Feather says, ""OK, get ready,"" we all strip down – men in shorts towels, women in long dresses and towels. Our bare feet are cold on the 20-degree ground. This is the most crowded sweat lodge I've attended. Many people are there because of the traumatic police violence that had unfolded a few days earlier at the camp; there's PTSD in the air, and a lot of nerves and pain to sweat out. The sweat lodge itself is a relatively small structure: a spherical half dome that looks sort of like an igloo made of fabric. The whole thing is maybe 12 feet in diameter and is no more than four feet high at its center point. You have to crawl in on your hands and knees, and it's impossible to stand up. The hot lava rocks are placed into the center of the lodge, and water is poured over them to create intense steam, heat and humidity. When the door flaps are closed, it is absolutely pitch dark. We pile in, women on one side, men on the other. Good Feather, with his Chanupa (or pipe) and drum, is near the door. It's uncomfortable, sitting on the hard, cold ground, cramped in with someone's knee in your back, your foot touching someone else's side, sitting cross-legged and freezing in the dark. But we're there together, and the camaraderie and support are palpable. Sweating and deep-breathing, I almost pass out from the intense humidity and drama of it all. There are five incredible singers and drummers inside who are pounding the drum and wailing away. Each song lasts 15 or 20 minutes, ending in call-and-response rapture. Cedar and bear root are sprinkled on the hot rocks, creating a thick, sweet smoke; when you breathe it in, it somehow opens you up. The drumming is rhythmic, passionate, strong and vocally acrobatic – voices that sound like they're coming from centuries in the past. ""We suffer together to understand the depths of what we care about,"" Good Feather says. ""When you do a vision quest, you stop eating and drinking. If you stop eating and drinking for 24 hours, the hunger for food falls away pretty quickly, but the thirst never leaves you. If you go without water for 24 hours, I guarantee you you will never waste a drop of water again. You'll think of every time you spilled some or left it on the ground or used it carelessly,"" he says. ""I think every politician should go without water for 24 hours."" Now it's time for others to speak. ""We have to keep our commitment to non-violence. Some people in the camp are getting agitated and angry. We need to constantly restate how we pray and how we stay with love, even love for those who are fighting against us. We must keep love in our hearts for the police,"" says one participant from the reservation, echoing a big topic of conversation lately at Standing Rock: how to love one's enemy. How can you love someone who's shooting at you? How can you love someone who's behaving in such a degrading manner toward you? ""I think we need to have a march. I think we need to have an action on Washington, D.C., to remind Obama, to get in Obama's face, and make our point that these police are out of control, and that we need the Department of Justice to step in, and that he needs to stop the pipeline. Obama says that he is worried about Trump reversing his decision, but let him do his job now, let him not operate out of fear. If Trump wants to take us on, we'll take it from there,"" says another person in the sweat lodge. (Such a march is now being planned for December 12th in D.C.) After four hours of sweat, rapture, discomfort and healing, the cathartic final song comes to a close. We pass the Chanupa around the circle and smoke a puff of ceremonial tobacco. We are thankful for the air and water all around us. We are thankful for each other. We are thankful for life and the earth. We stumble out into the night, among a billion stars.

For centuries the Exercises were most commonly given as a “long retreat” of about 30 days in solitude and silence. In recent years, there has been a renewed emphasis on the Spiritual Exercises as a program for laypeople. The most common way of going through the Exercises now is a “retreat in daily life,” which involves a monthslong program of daily prayer and meetings with a spiritual director. The Exercises have also been adapted in many other ways to meet the needs of modern people.

Sadhguru, with Nandita Das and Prahlad Kakkar, is interviewed by Times Now TV channel on what spirituality is and how it can benefit everyone. Blog Home » Yoga & Meditation » Demystifying Yoga Sep 19, 2013 5.6k Shares Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Mail Pinterest Times Now TV channel interviews yogi and mystic, Sadhguru, alongwith actress and director, Nandita Das and ad man Prahlad Kakkar, and explores the question “ What is spirituality? “ Sadhguru: Spirituality does not mean any particular practice. It is a certain way of being. To get there, there are many things to do. This is like a garden in your house. If the soil, sunlight or stem of a plant is in a certain way, it won’t yield flowers, you have to do something. You have to take care of those things. So if you cultivate your body, mind, emotions and energies to a certain level of maturity, something else blossoms within you – that is what is spirituality. When your rationale is immature, it doubts everything. When your rationale matures, it sees everything in a completely different light. Whenever any human being experiences something bigger than himself, the traditional way of looking at that is, “this is God…” The whole idea of God is just that – anything bigger than you. It could be a human being or an experience or some aspect of nature. But is this spiritual? No, this is just life. When I say “ just life “, I am not trying to dismiss it as a small thing. It is the greatest thing. Only when life becomes an overwhelming, powerful, blissful experience for you, you want to know what could have created this. If you want to know the process or the source of creation, the most intimate part of creation for you is your own body, isn’t it? There is a captive creator here, trapped within you. You shouldn’t miss him here. If you don’t miss him here, if you know the source of creation within you, you are spiritual. Does Belief in God Make You Spiritual? An atheist cannot be spiritual. But you must understand that even a theist cannot be spiritual. Because an atheist and a theist are not different . One believes there is God, another believes there is no God. Both of them are believing something that they do not know. You are not sincere enough to admit that you do not know, that’s your problem. So theists and atheists are not different. They are the same people putting up an act of being different. A spiritual seeker is neither a theist nor an atheist. He has realized that he does not know, so he is seeking. The moment you believe something, you become blind to everything else. The whole conflict on the planet is not between good and evil as they are trying to project it. It is always one man’s belief versus another man’s belief. The need for belief is more psychological than spiritual. You want to cling to something, you want to feel secure, you want to feel like you know it all. That is coming from a very immature mind. What is the problem if you don’t know anything about this existence. You actually don’t know anything. It’s beautiful! And you see how to make yourself beautiful and joyful within yourself, which is within your hands . What is a Spiritual Experience? Going to the ocean or to the mountain and seeking an experience may be beautiful, you must enjoy the world the way it is, but you must understand, the fish in the ocean doesn’t think it’s a spiritual experience, nor does the mountain goats think the mountain is a spiritual experience because they are there all the time. If you bring them to the city, they may think it’s a spiritual experience. It is the breaking of the barrier within you – something broke within you. You were in a shell. This broke and became a bigger shell. What I’m saying is, if you get used to the bigger shell, it feels the same way as the previous one. So if you want to become boundless and you are trying to attempt it through physicality, you are essentially trying to go towards boundlessness in installments. Can you count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and one day count to infinity? You will only become endless counting. That’s not the way. Through physical means, you can never reach towards boundless nature. Every human being is looking to become boundless. If you give him whatever he wants, for three days he is okay. The fourth day he is looking for something else. Somebody may label it as greed, I just say this is life process in the wrong direction. If you want to know boundless nature, you must experience, you must perceive something which is beyond the physical. Something you might have touched when you jumped into the ocean, when you saw a mountain, when you sang a song, when you danced, when you closed your eyes, in so many ways it could have happened to an individual. You touched it, but now the question is of sustainability. A Simple Practice One thing is, we can put you on to something very simple, which is subjective. Any subjective technology cannot be taught to you in uncommitted atmospheres. So if you are willing to give yourself a small space of time that is very committed and focused, we can put you on a simple practice, where investing just 21 minutes a day ( Inner Engineering ), you can start your day with a very phenomenal spiritual experience within you. A very powerful experience that leaves you peaceful and joyful throughout the day. Apart from that, to sustain it, one simple thing every human being has to do is, make your sense of involvement indiscriminate. If you look at a person, a tree, or a cloud, you are equally involved. You are equally involved with your own body and the breath. If you have no discrimination as to which is better, and you are equally involved with every aspect in life, then you will be constantly spiritual. Nobody needs to teach you what is spirituality.

Although all Catholics are expected to pray together at Mass , there are many different forms of spirituality and private prayer which have developed over the centuries. Each of the major religious orders of the Catholic Church and other lay groupings have their own unique spirituality - its own way of approaching God in prayer and in living out the Gospel . Contents 1 Catholic devotional piety 2 Desert spirituality 3 Monastic orders 3.1 Benedictine spirituality 3.2 Franciscan spirituality 3.3 Dominican spirituality 3.4 Ignatian spirituality 3.5 Carmelite spirituality 3.6 Redemptorist spirituality 3.7 Servite spirituality 3.8 Montfortian spirituality 4 Post-Vatican II lay movements 4.1 Charismatic spirituality 4.2 Schoenstatt Movement 4.3 Focolare Movement 4.4 Sant'Egidio movement 4.5 Opus Dei spirituality 4.6 Regnum Christi Spirituality 4.7 Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Catholic devotional piety [ edit ] Main article: Catholic devotions Further information: Devotional literature Catholic piety is based on the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. Although Jesus along with the Father, and the Holy Spirit is the focus of Catholic faith, Jesus was also the founder. The fundamental relationship of Jesus Christ, Son of God is with his Father. As Son, Jesus is always in communion with God the Father. All throughout his life, his prayer starts with ""Father', and the prayer he taught his disciples starts with ""Our Father"". From this the Catholic Church has developed a piety that mirrors Jesus's attitude. The Mass, the central prayer of the Church, also refers to the Father. Desert spirituality [ edit ] Desert spirituality is a way of seeking God that is characterized by the ""desert theology"" of the Old Testament that is at the very heart of the Judeo-Christian tradition, namely God keeping his People wandering for 40 years in the desert , [1] and also throughout the subsequent centuries repeatedly calling them into the desert, as a testing ground where they may experience a change of heart and, by proving themselves obedient to his ordering of human living, accept him, their Creator, again as their Lord. In New Testament times it is likewise for the reason of proving his obedience that Jesus of Nazareth underwent testing in the desert (cf. Matthew 4:1-11 = Mark 1:12-13 = Luke 4:1-13 ). The Christian eremitic vocation has the same purpose, as the name hermit applied to those that embrace it indicates. Among those most widely known for living a desert spirituality during the early Christian centuries is St Anthony of Egypt (251-356). He lived as a hermit for ten years, practiced asceticism for his whole life, and grew his own food for sustenance. From the life of someone alone being dedicated to seeking God in the desert, which is the earliest form of Christian monasticism , the monastic life in community has emerged, although the eremitic vocation continues as a distinct way of seeking God even today. In practical terms this spiritual quest is pursued through prayer in solitude and asceticism. Some adherents of desert spirituality – whether as eremitic or cenobitic monastics , or as Christian faithful outside the religious life – practise centering prayer . Though seriously disputed as anachronistic and of modern, Eastern origin, this practice is in truth prominent in Catholic practice (at least) as early as the 13th century, as evinced by works such as The Cloud of Unknowing - written anonymously in Middle English by a Catholic monastic. This is meditation on a single, sacred word that is meant to draw the believer closer to God by withdrawing compulsive infatuation with particular sensory objects and conceptual constructions Monastic orders [ edit ] Benedictine spirituality [ edit ] Benedictine spirituality is characterized by striving towards Christian perfection in community, liturgical prayer, and separation from worldly concerns. St. Benedict (480-550) is considered to be the Father of Western Monasticism. He wrote The Rule and established his first monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy. Lectio Divina is a Benedictine prayer form based on praying with the Word of God. Lectio Divina has four ""moments"": Lectio (Reading Scripture), Meditatio (Reflection on the Word), Oratio (Praying), and Contemplatio (Silently listening to God). Key people involved in the 20th and 21st century include Thomas Merton and Basil Pennington . Franciscan spirituality [ edit ] Franciscan spirituality is characterized by a life of poverty, love of nature, and giving charity to those in need. St. Francis of Assisi (1182–1226) was the son of a wealthy merchant. He rejected all of his possessions and founded a community of brothers (friars) who lived in poverty and helped the poor. Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in the wonder of creation. This is seen clearly in St. Francis' Canticle of the Sun . Franciscan spirituality is focused on walking in Christ's footsteps, understanding God by doing what Christ asked, experiencing and sharing God rather than discussing God. Dominican spirituality [ edit ] Dominican spirituality is characterized by poverty, love of preaching and devotion to truth. St. Dominic (1170–1221) encountered heretics on a journey in France. His opinion was that the people were not to blame - the preachers were. If there are good, orthodox preachers, then the people will be good and orthodox also. So, he founded the Order of Preachers , known as Dominicans who are drawn to contemplation of the Sacred Humanity of Jesus Christ. Throughout history, the Dominicans have helped to develop ways of praying which have aided people in deepening their relationship with God. The Rosary is an example of a prayer developed by the Dominicans. Some traditional legends say that the Rosary was given in its current form to St. Dominic by Mary. The Rosary is characteristic of Dominican spirituality because it focuses attention on the principal mysteries of the life of Jesus Christ, can lead to contemplation and is a way of proclaiming the truths of faith. Some members of the Dominican Order have made significant contributions to Catholic thought. The theological insight provided by St. Thomas Aquinas continues to be a major reference point for the Church today. Further, St Thomas made several defenses against critics who would suggest that physical labor was essential and missing for the relatively new order. He argued that intellectual, and consequently teaching, tasks were the equal to the Benedictine idea of physical labor being a superior form of contemplative prayer. Ignatian spirituality [ edit ] Ignatian spirituality is characterized by examination of one's life, discerning the will of God, finding God in all things (hence their motto ""Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam"", or ""For the Greater Glory of God""), and living the Resurrection. St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556) was a wounded soldier when he first began to read about Christ and the saints. He had a conversion experience while healing and decided to found the Society of Jesus, known as the Jesuits. His classic, the Spiritual Exercises is a guide for making a retreat. Jesuits are quite diverse, despite rumors to the contrary, but are united by a zeal that comes from every Jesuit making the Spiritual Exercises. Lay Catholics are allowed to take a shortened version of the Exercises at retreat houses, which are based on an individual spiritual guidance; wherein the retreat master guides each retreatant separately to what (s)he is going through and what the Holy Spirit guides. Ignatian Spirituality takes from other orders concepts and incorporates them. For example, finding God in all things - aka 'contemplative in action' - is heavily based on the spirituality of St Francis of Assisi, whom Ignatius admired. Another example is meditating on Scripture that comes from the Benedictine concept of Lectio Divina . However, it must be noted that Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable to the times, as is clear when one reads the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991)- A famous and beloved Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983 - was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability is the suggestion that one retreat participant can heavily use their imagination to assist in discerning whereas another needs to empty their mind. Carmelite spirituality [ edit ] Carmelite spirituality is characterised by interior detachment, silence, solitude, the desire for spiritual progress and insight into mystical experiences. The roots of the Carmelite Order go back to a group of hermits living on Mt. Carmel in Israel during the 12th Century. Ss. John of the Cross (1542–1591) and Teresa of Ávila (1515–1582) were both Carmelite mystics whose writings are considered to be spiritual classics. In his work The Ascent of Mount Carmel , St. John of the Cross teaches that purgation of the soul through mortification and suppression of desires is necessary for the soul while it journeys through darkness before entering into divine union with God. Teresa of Avila emphasized the importance of mental prayer which she defined as ""spending time with a friend whom we know loves us."" Other important figures in Carmelite Spirituality include Thérèse of Lisieux (Doctor of the Church), Mary Magdalene de Pazzi , Sister Lúcia of Fátima , Nuno of Saint Mary , Elizabeth of the Trinity , Marie-Antoinette de Geuser known as ""Consumata"", Edith Stein , Teresa of the Andes , Teresa Margaret of the Sacred Heart , Joaquina de Vedruna , Angelus of Jerusalem , and Brother Lawrence Redemptorist spirituality [ edit ] Redemptorist spirituality consists of: the Crib, the Cross the Sacrament . In other words, the Redemptorists follow Christ in his incarnation, death and resurrection and believe that he is always with them. They hold the belief that there is always a great encounter with Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, hence Saint Alphonsus wrote the Visit to the Blessed Sacrament and the Blessed Virgin Mary. He also wrote the popular Way of the Cross, and composed Christmas carols . The Redemptorist spirituality is a practical one, render help to the abandoned both spiritual and material. The heart of Redemptorist spirituality is the Gospel Invitation ""to follow Jesus Christ."" One of the most tangible ways they do this is to proclaim the gospel in simple ways to ordinary people, and to radiate the motto of Christ who read from the scroll of the prophet Isaiah , “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me…. to preach Good News to the Poor…. liberty to captives…. sight to the blind…. to proclaim the year of the Lord's Favour. ( Luke 4:18-19) Servite spirituality [ edit ] The spirituality of the Servite order is focused on contemplating Mary at the foot of the cross as a model for Christian life, and service to the suffering. Moreover, because the order has Seven Holy Founders , rather than one individual founder, there is a particular emphasis on the communal aspect of Christian life. This spirituality finds expression particularly in the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows . Montfortian spirituality [ edit ] God Alone was the motto of Saint Louis de Montfort and is repeated over 150 times in his writings. God Alone is also the title of his collected writings. Briefly speaking, based on his writings, Montfortian spirituality can be summed up via the formula: ""To God Alone, by Christ Wisdom, in the Spirit, in communion with Mary, for the reign of God."" Although St Louis is perhaps best known for his Mariology and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary , his spirituality is founded on the mystery of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, and is centered on Christ, what is visible in his famous Prayer to Jesus . Post-Vatican II lay movements [ edit ] See also Laity in the Catholic Church The Second Vatican Council accelerated the diversification of spiritual movements among Catholics, and some lay Catholics now engage in regular contemplative practices such as Centering prayer , although this is still controversial. Many contemporary spiritual movements emphasize the necessity both of an interior relationship with God (private prayer) and works of justice and mercy. Major 20th century writers who sought to draw together the active and contemplative poles of Christian spirituality have been Dorothy Day , Thomas Merton and Richard Rohr . The purpose of all lay movements in the Catholic Church is to spread in society a deep awareness that every single person is called to live a holy life and each in his own way to become an apostle of Jesus Christ . For the majority of Christians, God calls them to sanctify themselves through their ordinary lives by works of charity and devotion cultivated in the family, the domestic church, in the neighborhood and parish life as well as the workplace all of which are paths to holiness. Charismatic spirituality [ edit ] Main article: Catholic Charismatic Renewal Not far from the Ignatian spirituality in regard to its understanding of faith, Charismatic spirituality is in fact the re-exploration of different Catholic spiritual currents with an emphasis on personal experience generally shared in groups. Schoenstatt Movement [ edit ] Main article: Schoenstatt Movement Schoenstatt emphasizes a strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, upholding her as a perfect example of love and purity. Schoenstatt seeks to invite the Blessed Mother (and, hence, her divine Son, Jesus Christ), into the home by establishing a spiritual Covenant of Love with her. It encourages its members to have the faith and purity of children, and to think of Mary as their mother. Focolare Movement [ edit ] Main article: Focolare Movement In 1943 in Northern Italy during World War II, Chiara Lubich , together with a small group of friends, concluded that God is the only ideal worth living for. The Focolare movement was founded as a result. The goal was to strive towards the fulfillment of Jesus’ prayer to the Father: “That they all may be one.” (John 17:21). A spirituality of unity resulted and gave rise to a movement of spiritual and social renewal. Now embracing over 5 million members in 182 countries, Focolare (which means hearth) draws together groups of families, neighbors and friends to share build community and extend the works of the Gospel. Sant'Egidio movement [ edit ] The Sant'Egidio community began with a group of high school students in the 1960s who were convinced by a local priest in Rome to try an experiment—to try to live for a time as the early Christian disciples did, gathering for prayer and shared meals daily in their neighborhood as well as joining together in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The community thrived and has now become a global movement of communities working for peace and justice in a spirit of daily common life and prayer. Opus Dei spirituality [ edit ] Main article: Opus Dei Opus Dei predated the Second Vatican Council in its emphasis on the laity. Founded by St. Josemaría Escrivá , Opus Dei's spirituality is based on life lived in the secular world. The ""sanctification of work"" consists in offering all work, however ordinary, to God. This implies that one always does one's best. To be a contemplative is to integrate one's life (""unity of life"") in faithfulness to the Catholic Church and in solidarity with all those with whom one comes into contact, living a life of faith in all circumstances of each day. As John Allen says: people who follow this spirituality enter a church and leave it for the same reason—to get closer to God. The members of Opus Dei and its cooperators have committed to convert their daily work into prayer. Pope John Paul I , a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness . While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escrivá ""it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity"", thus providing a lay spirituality. [2] Expressed this way, Opus Dei builds on ""finding God in all things"" from Ignatian spirituality and emphasizes the universality of this call to holiness. Regnum Christi Spirituality [ edit ] Main article: Regnum Christi Regnum Christi focuses on the mission of every baptized person to evangelize. Each member is called to pray, meet in community and do some form of apostolate (which varies from member to member). Their motto is ""Love Christ, Serve People, Build the Church."" They express their ethos as loving CHrist, Mary, Souls, the Church, and the Pope. Regnum Christi is somewhat unique among the lay movements as it is bound to a religious community, the Legion of Christ . Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality [ edit ] Main article: Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg In Frankfurt , Germany in 2007 the Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality was founded by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg . In and by the centre different kinds of church services are offered like for example with elements such as expressionist dance , moreover days of exercises of christian mysticism , meditative singing , meditation courses, contemplative prayer, Zen -meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises and retreats [3] See also [ edit ] Catholicism portal Christian mysticism French school of spirituality Lay spirituality Communion and Liberation Emmanuel Community Neocatechumenal Way Regnum Christi References [ edit ] ^ Numbers 13:3 , Numbers 13:26 ^ prayer with the spiritual assistance of the prelature.

To me, the place seemed a bit too dark which hid the awesome ambience/decor. The interiors are classy and luxurious by all means. They serve draught as well as regular beers and in addition, plenty of other whiskies, wines and other beverages. Most guests at the Asia Alive were being served beverages on their dining tables. In all, there were nearly 80% expats/foreigners out there and we didn't miss a Japanese business group enjoying their drinks and starters over a ppt slide (on a laptop). Its a soothing and serene place with lovely notes of music all over the bar. But again, please do something about the lighting part. Its not a shady pub please !! Hospitality is at its best and F&B staff here is very courteous. It was our second visit to this hotel which is located at an edge, echeloned from the Sector-58, 61 Sectors of Gurgaon. The approach road to this place is a turn-off and this hotel is a definite challenging job for its GM and other staff, to bring business to its house. To be very honest, while this hotel is well located, the surroundings to include approach road are not good enough. Recommended more for the in-hotel guests as others have many options of dining n wining in Gurgaon.

47," What Is Spirituality? What is Spirituality? Its Effect on Your Well-Being “What is spirituality?” This is a question posed by religious leaders, scientists and secularists alike. For some, the term “spirituality” suffers from a bad image. It has negative connotations. It may also imply paranormal experiences. For others, spirituality is a synonym for faith and religion. Many people aspire to live what we can call a spiritual life. They would never consider it so, nor express it accordingly. Yet, they're on a spiritual journey. Their life reflects the stages of spiritual growth . Their actions express the basic nature of a popular definition of spirituality. The issue is a complex one. Religious leaders and scientists have stepped into the debate. They're attempting to clarify what they see as the meaning and the effect, if any. Medical professionals sit on both sides of the fence. Many, alternative and conventional, now believe some connection between being healthy and spirituality does exist. The issue, for the scientists, is why? Defining Spirituality How then can we define spirituality? Is it truly a religious off shoot? Does it have links with the occult? Does it even exist? The current Dalai Lama has no difficulty defining spirituality. He writes in Ancient Wisdom, Modern World that “spirituality is concerned with those qualities of the human spirit – such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony – which brings happiness to both self and others…” Even those of us who are not Buddhists can relate to what the Dalai Lama is saying. Generally, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, love and compassion are desirable traits. In fact, they're sometimes downright necessary for the world to survive intact. Prayers and/or meditation often bring us closer to understanding the values incorporated in spirituality. They can result in spiritual growth and development. Yet, at the very heart of such actions is a realization that all humans consist of more than mind and body. It's present, whether you believe in it or not. Whether you're a skeptic or a believer, the question of what is spirituality is a debate that refuses to go away. In light of scientific research, the topic is increasingly becoming a popular one. This is, in part, the result of a specific perception - that connectivity between the body, the mind and the spirit exists. In fact, research indicates the impact of spiritual beliefs on the healing process . The Importance of Spirituality For those who understand the intricate connection between the body, the mind and the spirit, the answer to what is spirituality is important. We may continue to lead healthy and fruitful lives without spirituality. Yet, life improves when we embrace some form of it. In fact, by including some type of everyday spirituality into our lives, we may actually increase our ability to be healthier, live longer and decrease the debilitating problems resulting from stress and depression . This should indicate that we should all adopt a spiritual growth plan and seek the answer to ""what is spirituality?"". The Meaning Of Spirituality: A Few Final Words When it comes down to it, we're the ones who define our spirituality . The answer to the question, “What is spirituality?” depends upon our approach. If we are a Muslim, Christian, Jew or Neo-pagan, we look at spirituality in terms of our relationship with the God, Goddess or Gods. If we ignore the existence of any form of deity, spirituality may appear as the essence or feeling resulting from actions we take in our lives. ? In any case, asking a spiritual healer could be helpful to understand what is more useful and fulfilling for you. Whichever path you choose to follow, understanding our own spirituality will help ensure the healing process is complete . Mind, Body and Spirit will work together as one.

[ ? ]Subscribe To This Site Sharing with you a Real Opportunity to improve your economic condition in a nice way What clients say I went to Massimo for a healing session in which I experienced calmness and opening of my heart. All the sadness I had as a child and images from my childhood went by and were gone. An hour treatment went by like ten minutes. In other times I experienced very deep meditations, quietness, yet very alert and awake. Thanks Massimo for helping me get in touch with the healing force within me. - Liat, Netanya, Israel Dear Massimo, thanks so much for your healing sessions. So many things changed and improved since the beginning of your treatments. You are very gifted and all you are doing arises from the depth of your heart and the depth of the knowledge you channel. I highly recommend you as a healer. - Zvi, Tel Aviv, Israel Good luck: with this single word I can express what I feel to have met Massimo. I have been knowing him for 10 years and working with him I have done a path to awareness. He is a good teacher, sincere, honest, which guides you to the truth and peace that our heart desires and can achieve. - Tiziana, Arezzo, Italy For me, healing means integrity and the consistency of living my daily life, relationships and job in the way of my true ""I"". Massimo has the rare ability to lead people, and therefore me, to transform obstacles that stand between you and what you want to realize in available energy. He does so with great respect, patience and lack of judgment. Massimo, thanks for all that I get from you. - Maria, Udine, Italy ? ? When Massimo gave me healing sessions online, I experienced him as a sensitive and dedicated man who has the gift to sense into deeper layers of the soul and affect them in a gentle and non intruding way. His careful way of approaching the pain in my eyes and the feedback he gave me from his sensitive perceptions helped me to gain trust and confidence in my healing process. - Norbert, Vienna, Austria Home - About Me - Privacy - Disclaimer - Blog - Site Map - Contact ©2012-2013 - Spiritual Healing For You - All Rights Reserved "
48," 20 Important Spiritual Instructions Download Free Books on Yoga, Religion & Philosophy Online Bookstore THE DIVINE LIFE SOCIETY HOME TEACHINGS MESSAGES RELIGIONS DISCOURSE SAINTS SWAMI SIVANANDA FAQ ANNOUNCEMENTS SITE MAP BRANCHES MULTIMEDIA LINKS View Archives Sri Swami Chidananda has wonderfully explained these instruction in detail in his book ""20 Important Spiritual Instructions"" . 20 Important Spiritual Instructions By Sri Swami Sivananda These twenty instructions contain the very essence of all Yoga Sadhana , Karma , Bhakti , Jnana and Yoga will all come to one who follows them whole-heartedly. They are the unfailing keys to quick and effective development and culture of the physical, mental, moral and spiritual self of man. 1. BRAHMAMUHURTA Get up at 4 a.m. daily. This is Brahmamuhurta which is extremely favourable for Sadhana. Do all your morning spiritual Sadhana during this period from 4 a.m. to 6:30 or 7 a.m. Such Sadhana gives quick and maximum progress. 2. ASANA Sit on Padmasana (lotus pose), Siddhasana (adept's pose) or Sukhasana (any pose you like) for your Japa and meditation for half an hour, facing east or north. Increase the period gradually to three hours. Practice Sirshasana (headstand) and Sarvangasana (shoulderstand) for maintenance of health and Brahmacharya . Take light physical exercises as walking, etc., regularly. Do twenty rounds of easy, comfortable Pranayama (breathing exercises). Do not strain yourself while doing Pranayama. 3. JAPA You can repeat any Mantra (sacred syllable), such as pure Om or Om Namo Narayanaya, Sri Ram, Sita Ram, Sri Ram Jaya Ram Jaya Jaya Ram, Om Namah Sivaya, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Om Saravanabhavaya Namah, Hari Om, or Gayatri (a sacred Vedic Mantra), according to your taste or inclination, from 108 times to 21,600 times daily. Devotees of Christ may repeat the name Jesus or Hail Mary , Mother of Jesus. Parsis, Sikhs and Muslims may select a name or Mantra from the Zend Avesta, Granth Sahib or Koran respectively. 4. DIETETIC DISCIPLINE Take Sattvic food. Give up chillies, tamarind, garlic, onion, sour articles, oil, mustard, asafoetida. Observe moderation in diet (Mitahara). Do not overload the stomach. Give up those things which the mind likes best for a fortnight once or twice in a year. Eat simple simple food. Milk and fruits help concentration. Take food as medicine to keep the life going. Eating for enjoyment is a sin. Give up salt and sugar for a week or a fortnight. You must be able to live on rice, dhal and bread without any pickle. Do not ask for extra salt for dhal, and sugar for tea, coffee and milk. People taking non-vegetaraian diet should try their best to gradually give up flesh-eating as completely as possible. They will be immensely benefited. 5. MEDITATION Have a separate meditation room under lock and key. If this is not possible then a corner of the room should be set apart with a small cloth screen or curtain drawn across. Keep the room spotlessly clean. 6. SVADHYAYA Study systematically the Gita , Ramayana , Bhagavatam , Vishnu-Sahasranama , Lalita-Sahasranama , Adityahridaya , Upanishads , Yoga Vasishta , Bible , Imitation of Christ , Zend Avesta , Quran , the Tripitakas , the Granth Sahib and other religious books from half an hour to one hour daily, and have Suddha Vichara (pure thoughts). 7. ELEVATE THE MIND Get by heart some prayer - Slokas (prayer verses), Stotras (hymns) and repeat them as soon as you sit in the Asana before starting Japa or meditation. This will elevate the mind quickly. 8. BRAHMACHARYA Preserve the vital force (Veerya (seminal energy)) very, very carefully. Veerya is God in motion or manifestation (Vibhuti). Veerya is all power. Veerya is all money. Veerya is the essence of life, thought and intelligence. This instruction is not for bachelors only. Householders also must follow it as far as possible. They must be extremely moderate in their marital connections with their spouse. This is very important. 9. CHARITY Do charity regularly, every month, or even daily according to your means. Never fail in this item. If necessary forego some personal wants but keep up this charity regularly. 10. HAVE SATSANG Give up bad company, smoking, meat and alcoholic liquors entirely. Have constant Satsang (association with holy people). Do not develop any evil habits. Deliberately exert to develop positive virtuous qualities. 11. FAST Fast on Ekadasi (11th day of the Hindu lunar fortnight) or live on milk and fruits only. Christians must fast on alternate Sundays, Muslims on alternate Fridays, and Parsis on a suitable day every fortnight. 12. JAPA MALA Have a Japa Mala (rosary) around your neck or in your pocket or underneath your pillow at night. This will remind you of God. Twirl the beads during your leisure. You should repeat the Name at all times, whatever task you may be engaged in. 13. OBSERVE MOUNA Observe Mouna (vow of silence) for a couple of hours daily. Do not make gestures and inarticulate noises during the period of silence. 14. DISCIPLINE OF SPEECH Speak the truth at all cost. Speak a little. Speak sweetly. Always utter encouraging words. Never condemn, criticize or discourage. Do not raise your voice and shout at little children or subordinates. 15. BE CONTENT Reduce your wants. If you have four shirts, reduce the number to three or two. Lead a happy, contented life. Avoid unnecessary worry. Be mentally detached. Have plain living and high thinking. Think of those who do not possess even one-tenth of what you have. Share with others. 16. PRACTICE LOVE Never hurt anybody. Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah (Non-injury is the highest virtue). Control anger by love, Kshama (forgiveness) and Daya (compassion). Serve the sick and the poor with love and affection. This is service of God. 17. BE SELF RELIANT Do not depend upon servants. Self-reliance is the highest of all virtues. 18. HAVE SELF-ANALYSIS Think of the mistakes you have committed during the course of the day, just before retiring to bed (self-analysis). Keep a daily spiritual diary and self-correction register as Benjamin Franklin did. Maintain a daily routine and resolve-form . Do not brood over past mistakes. 19. DO YOUR DUTY Remember that death is awaiting you at every moment. Never fail to fulfil your duties. Have pure conduct (Sadachara). 20. REMEMBER GOD Think of God as soon as you wake up and just before you go to sleep, and at all other times whether engaged in any work or not. Repeat His Name always. Surrender yourself completely to God (Saranagati). This is the essence of all spiritual Sadhana. It will lead you to liberation. All these spiritual canons must be rigidly observed. You must not give any leniency to the mind. Last Updated: Wednesday, 09-Nov-2016 20:06:38 EST Mail Questions, Comments & Suggestions to : "

I’ve looked into Zen, Theravada Buddhism, Occultism, Taoism, New Age, Yoga, Vedanta, etc. These traditions share many common practices, principles, and goals – and yet there are profound differences in approaches, beliefs, and worldviews. This post is my effort of putting it all together, and presenting an overview of the common goals and practice of different spiritual paths. You don’t need to follow an institutionalised religion in order to have a fruitful spiritual life. Spiritual but not religious is a way too. This doesn’t imply, however, that you reject tradition. Tradition is there to serve you, and it would be silly to throw away the collective development of mystics over millennia and try to reinvent the wheel. Find a wisdom tradition that speaks to your heart, then study and practice the core of it. Just don’t outsource your spiritual journey – own it, explore with your own feet, experiment with the teachings, and trust your own discernment. My goal with this post is to present an overview of the spiritual landscape – something you can use to understand and classify the different practices/paths, and find the path most suitable for you. I don’t pretend to know all the answers; rather, I’m openly sharing some reflections and insights gained along the way. I hope you take something out of this! At the bottom of this page you will find a button to download a FREE PDF copy of this post, for easy reference. The Drive for Spirituality Why do you need spirituality? What is the point? Just like meditation is different things for different people, so it is with spirituality. I know what spirituality means to me, but I wanted to have a broader view on the spectrum of different perspectives on this. So, in July this year, I asked my readers: What is spirituality for you, and why is it important? And got hundreds of different responses. Looking at the common themes in the answers, I can say that people interested in following a spiritual path are looking for one or more of the following eight things. [ These are ordered according to the number of answers I received for each. ] PURPOSE / DIRECTION . Whether you are on the top of the wheel of material life or on the bottom, there is an underlying sense of dissatisfaction, limitation, and emptiness. Some people are sensitive to this, others aren’t, or they try to fill this up by chasing external goals endlessly. Spirituality is a search for meaning, for purpose and direction in life. It fulfils our need to have a foundation for living, a path or way of life in the light of a larger context. It speaks to the need to be “aligned” with something bigger than our body and mind. ONENESS / LOVE / CONNECTION . This speaks to our sense of separation and incompleteness. Because it is painful, we seek connection and love – either in a community, or in being one with the universe, or connecting with the Divine (whatever shape this may take). To feel complete, we crave to receive and give unconditional love, which brings a sense of total acceptance and of happiness in being alive. This search can also manifest as returning to the source, to God, or to a sense of sacredness. GROWTH . There is an innate drive in many of us to evolve, to improve, to push the boundaries, reach our full potential. The drive to continuously grow and learn, live a life authentic to our truth, develop our mind, cultivate virtues, and expand our consciousness. ANSWERS / TRUTH . Questions like “Who am I?”, “Why are we here?”, and “What else is there?” together with a drive to understand how life works and to learn about ourselves. For some this takes the form of understanding, absorbing, and becoming one with the absolute Truth. HAPPINESS / PEACE / OVERCOME SUFFERING . Suffering is the initial door of spirituality for many people. When our mind depends on external things for happiness, its experience of happiness will be inconstant, unreliable, impermanent – just like external causes are. It has been rightly coined as “stock market happiness”. Since suffering is a mental phenomenon, and spiritual practices are a means to transform one’s mind, it is a wise way of seeking a better life. Hence, there is the drive to seek happiness and peace internally . Or to at least to diminish the suffering that we are experiencing. Spirituality helps us gain balance, independence from external cases, and a greater appreciation of life. TRANSCENDENCE / ENLIGHTENMENT . Different traditions describe enlightenment differently. But the common theme is that it is a state of transcendence from the human condition, beyond all possibility of further suffering. There is a radical and permanent shift in our perception and experience of the world, and a moving beyond the sense of being an individual, or a person. It’s the urge to experience ultimate peace or freedom, to find the ultimate reality of who we are, transcend the ego, or “merge with God”. EXPLORATION / MYSTERY . Diving into one’s own consciousness and exploring other aspects of reality is something that speaks to our thirst for knowledge, experience, and adventure. Learning the mysteries of life and nature, exploring the sacred, and living with a sense of wonder. SERVING . The urge to serve people in a deeper level, making a big difference in their life, and helping the upliftment of humanity. So these are the possible reasons for exploring spirituality. Having a greater clarity on what is the drive behind your search can be helpful when choosing which path or practices to take. Some of these things may not speak to you at all, while you feel a great attraction for others. It’s all good – that is why there are different paths out there, to match seekers of different temperaments, stages of development, values, and goals. For me, personally, the pull was always truth, transcendence, enlightenment; though I can see I got benefits in all the other areas as well. In a way, all these drives have one thing in common: they show we are not satisfied with only the material side of life, and we wish to move beyond this limitation. The Goals of Spirituality The goal is defined differently in each path. Here are just a few examples: Buddhism: achieve the cessation of suffering (enlightenment, nirvana ); see reality for what it is; uproot the mental defilements. Yoga: purify the mind so to achieve liberation ( moksha ); uniting the individual soul with the universal Soul; becoming one with the Absolute Consciousness; be the true Self. Vedanta: realise the true Self; dissolve the knot of the ego, which limits pure Consciousness to a body-mind. Sufism : experience divine revelation; surrender to God; serve God. Christian Mysticism : experience union with God; the kingdom of heaven; feel the love of the creator. Daoism/Taoism : live in harmony with the Dao; cultivate body, mind, and spirit; cultivating and sublimating energy. Kabbalah : learn the ultimate laws of the universe; know the creator and oneself, and live accordingly. Jainism : liberation; salvation; karmic purification; become a perfected-being ( Siddha ). Shamanism : live in harmony and connection with Nature; develop knowledge and power to work with invisible forces; serve the spiritual welfare of the community; heal the soul. Regardless of how the goal is framed, and the philosophy behind it, wisdom traditions ultimately offer us techniques for personal transformation, for moving beyond our personal shell. This can be for the sake of growth, service, transcendence, overcoming suffering, union with a higher principle, internal freedom, happiness, etc. Spiritual Disciplines Every spiritual practice should serve a definite purpose, according to what drives us to spirituality, and the goal we are seeking. I call this approach pragmatic spirituality . It’s not about continuing a tradition, or doing something because “we feel we should”, but to actively explore our inner world, driven by a specific question, thirst, or goal. In the beginning you may not know exactly what this pull is. That’s ok – it’s enough that it is authentic. Here is an overview of the different types of spiritual practice, across multiple traditions. They seems to fall into three categories: (a) practices of personal cultivation, sublimation, and exploration. (b) practices of learning, understanding, absorbing. (c) practices of external action. CULTIVATION & SUBLIMATION Meditation . It’s an exercise of controlling your attention. The three main general types of meditation are: focused attention (concentrating your mind on a single point); open monitoring (being aware of whatever is in your experience in the present moment); pure awareness (resting the attention on consciousness, undistracted and unengaged). Meditation is specially emphasised in the spiritual traditions that originated from India (Buddhism, Vedanta, Yoga, Tantra, Jainism, etc.). To learn more check out my getting started page and my 5-Week Meditation Course . Prayer . Present in all theistic paths, prayer is an exercise of directing our mind to the Divine, with devotion and surrender. It may be scripted or spontaneous; spoken out loud, silently in the mind, or without words (pure communion). Breath & Energy Work . These are specific ways of breathing and moving our attention through the body. They are often accompanied by visualization or repetition of sacred sounds ( mantras ). It can be done for the purpose of healing, energizing, purifying, calming, contemplating, etc. Examples are the pranayama from Yoga and the qigong from Daoism. It is also advised as a preparation exercise for meditation, which is more subtle and internal. Somatic Techniques . In conjunction to breath-work, some traditions use body postures and movements for developing health, freeing energy flow, and other purposes. Here we have the asanas of Yoga, Buddhist mudras , and several exercises from the Daoist tradition and Tantric schools. Qualities of Mind/Heart . All traditions speak of the development of certain qualities of mind and heart. Common virtues that are valued are: tranquility, equanimity, humility, detachment, loving-kindness, compassion, trust, devotion, discipline, courage, mindfulness, concentration, truthfulness, morality, discernment, and energy. These are developed through reflection, study, specific meditation and breathing techniques, and mainly by being mindful of them in our moment-after-moment choices ( these tools can help!). Chanting . Chanting is used in some paths as a means of prayer, study, and focusing of the mind in preparation for meditation. In devotional paths it is used for developing feelings of surrender and devotion; in other traditions, key texts are sometimes chanted instead of being read, as a help for memorization and contemplation. Asceticism . Periods of intense self-discipline, simplicity, and no self-indulgence. These include fasting, intensive retreats, vows of silence, abstinence, long hours of meditation, etc. It’s like a “mind detox” or “spiritual cleansing”, and it’s a great way to burn negative patterns and quickly advance in the practice. It develops will power, self-control, and a sense of peace and contentment that depends on nothing else. In Yoga traditions they call this tapas . LEARNING & ABSORBING Study & Contemplation . Listening to talks or reading spiritual texts of a tradition, and thinking deeply about the meaning and implications of those teachings. This can be both the foundational texts and commentary literature. We find this in basically all traditions. In Christianity it is called lectio divina ; in Raja Yoga they call it swadhyaya . Some seek to actually memorize the whole texts. The purpose of study is gaining understanding, insight, and wisdom. The contemplation aspect is to think how those teachings apply to my life, what it means to me, and how knowing these will change the way I see the world and act. The teachings are often to be seen as a model to understand reality , and not necessarily as precise descriptions of reality. They are a framework of how to relate to things, and how to practice the path – and as such is either useful or not-useful. Community & Teacher Relationship . The relationship with the teacher, and spending time in a community of practitioners, is a valuable way to not only learn the tradition, but absorb the gist of it. A community offers: support in overcoming difficulties on the way; motivation; insight on the finer aspects of practice; answers; and like-minded people with whom to relate. In some traditions the texts are considered of secondary importance, while a personal relationship with the teacher or guru is seen as essential for the growth of the student/disciple. Some of them emphasise a “heart to heart” transmission that happens through initiation, and spending time with the teacher ( satsang ). Belief . In some spiritual traditions, having faith on certain basic tenets is the entry door to the practice. Other paths, like Buddhism and Yoga, are more experiential by nature, and tend to require little or no belief. In any case, it is natural that as you start deepening in a path, and experiencing real progress, you gain more confidence in the wisdom behind the teachings – even the ones you don’t understand yet. EXTERNAL ACTION Ethics . Following a set of principles or specific rules of behavior. In Buddhism, for instance, the five basic precepts are: (1) do not cause harm; (2) do not say what is untrue; (3) do not take what is not given; (4) do not engage in sexual misbehavior; (5) do not use intoxicants. Most traditions have similar instructions. They are deeper than what they appear on the surface, and they exist so that our actions in body, speech and mind support and reflect the truth we are seeking. Ritual . Some traditions are more ritualistic, but basically all of them involve some type of ritual. A ritual is basically any set of actions that are done in the same way, for a specific purpose. Usually a feeling of reverence, seriousness, or intensity is associated with them. The ultimate purpose of rituals is to develop certain feelings or states of mind – and not to put up a show. Service . Serving the community – be it other spiritual practitioners, or society at large – can be an expression of one’s spiritual commitment. Feeding the poor, social reform, translation of scriptures, supporting online communities, etc. What makes it “spiritual” is not so much the type of work done, but the attitude, heart, and intention behind it. You don’t need to do all these trainings. Each path emphasizes certain practices, and gives them a unique flavor. If you don’t know where to start, I would suggest having one core cultivation practice (meditation or prayer), together with the three foundations of “developing qualities”, “ethics” and “study”. Do you know of any practice that is not adequately present in this spiritual disciplines list? Let me know below, in the comments section. Spiritual Paths A question that is often raised is: “Should I follow one specific tradition, or learn from many?” In my experience, you need a bit of both. Learn about as many traditions as you feel attracted to, and eventually choose one as your main approach, and focus on that. Review your choice from time to time as you mature in the journey. This is better than following one tradition without knowing much about any other, because you might not be following the one that is most efficacious for you. Or, even if you are, knowing the practices and concepts of other traditions can help you gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for your own. And perhaps even cover some of the shortcomings that particular tradition has for you. The other extreme – of reading and trying everything, but not committing to any specific practice – is also not so helpful. It is like moving one mile in ten directions, rather than ten miles in one direction. This attitude may indicate internal resistances that you are not aware of. Although there are countless paths, teachings, traditions, lineages, schools and masters, ultimately we can say there are 5 types of paths . Here is a brief introduction. Path of KNOWLEDGE . The core practices are study, contemplation, and meditation. Liberation happens through wisdom and insight , by clearly seeing who we are, and understanding reality as it is. Some traditions that fall into this approach are: Jnana Yoga, Vedanta, Buddhism, Kabbalah, Samkhya. Path of DEVOTION . The core practices are prayer, chanting, mantras, belief, ritual, and teacher relationship. Liberation happens by surrender of our ego into the higher Power Source/God/Consciousness. Examples are: Bhakti Yoga, Christianity, and Sufism. Path of MEDITATION . The core practices are meditation, breath work, asceticism, and teacher relationship. Liberation happens by stillness and meditative absorption, which burns through the impurities of the mind and heart. Examples are: Raja Yoga, Nada Yoga, Buddhism, Samaya Tantra, Jainism, Kashmir Shaivism. Path of SERVICE . The core practices are prayer, community, ethics and service. Liberation happens by active selflessness , the burning away of impurities that happen by the constant service without wanting anything back, not even recognition. This path is often coupled with that of devotion. Example are: Karma Yoga, Christianity, and the approach of some Buddhist lineages. Path of ENERGY . The core practices are meditation, breath work, somatic techniques, asceticism, teacher relationship, ritual. Liberation happens by sublimation and purification of our body, mind, and psyche. There is a great variety of paths here; some of them are more ritualistic; some emphasize the development of psychic powers or communication with invisible beings; others are strongly focused on physical health and longevity. Examples of traditions are: Tantra Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Kriya Yoga, Laya Yoga, Vajrayana Buddhism, Daoism, Shamanism. The practices of developing internal qualities, and ethics, are universal to all paths. There are lots of overlaps, but we can say that Knowledge, Surrender, Meditation, Service and Energy are the core elements of all spiritual practice. These are the main ways for achieving self-transcendence. Your own path can contain elements of more than one of these; or may also change from one to another, as you grow in your journey. Next Steps For the first time we have the wisdom teachings of all these traditions easily accessible, which is a boon. Hopefully this post has helped you make some sense of this universe of spirituality. By now you probably have a better idea of What drives you to seek spirituality What is your ultimate goal What types of spiritual practice most speak to you Which of the five main paths is the general approach you want to take For further reading, I highly recommend Timothy Conway’s excellent 12 Spiritual Temperaments article, and my recommended spiritual books list .

Related Posts Meditation is essential, but not enough Four meditation superpowers – why meditation matters Yoga For Life: An Integral Approach Joe haase I appreciate this informative post, describing aspects of spirituality. recently, I have been reading the book called, the way to love, by Anthony de Mello. I wonder where you would assign this kind of teaching into your category of spirituality. to me it seems much more Buddhist than Christian! and I am very much intrigued by it! Thank you for this informative post. Giovanni Dienstmann I haven’t read anything of Anthony de Mello much, so I can’t really say. Rita Jaipal Thanks for sharing this learnful and inspiring article Giovanni Dienstmann! Mark Rivera You asked “do you know of any practice that is not adequately present in this spiritual disciplines list?” And I think one candidate might be the path of Renunciation. I know in many Hindu and Buddhist sects there are certain “spiritually attained” individuals who manifest their “wisdom” or “skill” (or what have you) by renouncing the world of contemporary society, and moving off to some place in seclusion (or at least relative seclusion), surrounded by nothing by the purity and simplicity of nature. The pratyekabuddha would be an example of this, as would the transcendentalist movement typified by people like Thoreau, and books like “Walden.” Anyway, how would you assimilate the notion of those kinds of spiritual paths (Renunciation) into this discussion? Giovanni Dienstmann Hey Mark, Thanks for bringing that up. I see a life of renunciation as a practice of asceticism. Basically all traditions have people that have lived like that. So you will find renunciants of basically all types of paths, though they seem to be more common in the paths of knowledge and meditation. geribeth What an awesome and informative post! Thank you, Giovanni, for sharing your knowledge. I am particularly intrigued by how all paths are directed to the same – or similar – goals; differentiated only by the present state of the individual. I have only recently began the practice of meditation, which has led me to question the “truths” that I have learned over the years. It has inspired me to seek out new forms of spirituality and truth in the form of spiritual and scientific texts and archeological evidence, which has opened doors for me to find my own unique path. Thank you again for categorized and comparative look at spiritual attainment. It has given my logical & inquisitive mind much to ponder! Namaste / Giovanni Dienstmann That’s great to hear, Geribeth! B3 Spot On! Well played sir. Well played..Having been & currently on the path, having a road map laid out as concise & simplified as this would have saved me extra suffering from when I began. (; Thank you Giovanni for taking some of the confusion out of spiritually & putting it back on whats important to me. Being clearly focused on my goals for myself & others. *insert thumbs up Emoji Giovanni Dienstmann Thanks for sharing, B3! Walk on! ? shaun How about an article on the sublime spirituality of Nature ? For example, I remember being in the Rocky Mountains and looking down from a mountain top, then, turning my head a little bit sideways as well as down the long trench-type valley below. I focused my eyes on the down the valley, and suddenly I got an overpowering spiritual sense, that was full of very intense feelings and thoughts ; that somehow our existence fits a larger pattern of order , that the universe all makes sense somehow. I’m not religious, never have been, but on that day, I experienced a sublime, spiritual, sense of order in the world of Nature, in that moment of solitude in the Rockies. Giovanni Dienstmann That is an interesting topic indeed! Alexandra Marrero Thank you for this wonderful information! ? tedon Dear Giovanni, I came across your site and read various blogs and meditation and spirituality on it. I complement you on presenting your summaries with a deliberate attempt to be an observer rather than evaluater or promoter of any philosophy or technique. May I ask, do you think that anyone in human history, including the most admired, revered and even worshiped human beings, ever transcended their mind, their physical being and came into realm of un-manifested while in their physical mind-body? Giovanni Dienstmann According to Indian traditions (Yoga, Buddhism, Vedanta), that’s what happens with final Enlightenment. There is a complete insight and liberation into the Source of all, while in the body. tedon Thank you for your reply. I am aware of these traditions and the testimonies of the “enlightened” as well as those in the other traditions. I humbly submit my subjective opinion, that the manifested consciousness has about the same probability of simultaneously becoming un-manifested as the spaceship crossing the speed of light…Love the Star Trek and the stories of enlightenment however probable or improbable they are. Cheers! Giovanni Dienstmann The way I see it, it’s not a matter of the manifested consciousness becoming un-manifest. But rather the principle of not-two; that there is only one single stuff in the universe: pure-Consciousness. Manifest and un-manifest are just conventional ways of speaking about expressions of this one Substance. Enlightenment would be when the individualized consciousness fully realizes its true nature. Thus manifest and unmanifest are one and the same. This is the only “becoming” un-manifest. tedon Not to engage in fruitless pseudo-scientific-spiritual debate but the statement “there is only one single stuff in the universe: pure-Consciousness” even if “true”, has no objective proof yet. What we do know, philosophy aside, is that this Universe is real, humanity or no humanity. We can make a hypothesis that Universe is a manifestation of Consciousness, and then state that since Universe is expanding and changing, consciousness keeps manifesting. Thus its potential which has not yet been manifested can be called unmanifested consciousness. So if we make a giant leap of faith and say that Consciousness is indeed the background of this Creation, in our observation, it appears to be seeking manifestation of its ever greater potential, and perhaps the path to it, is through self awareness. And thus we practice it often wrapping it into various philosophies and ideas of enlightenment…This is my 5 cents. Giovanni Dienstmann Of course! The moment you speak of unmanifest consciousness, you are prompting me to talk in terms of philosophy (specially as a comment on a post about spirituality!). In my view, self awareness is indeed critical to this path. tedon I am indeed most interested in spirituality, but the “scientist” in me, has not seen any shred of evidence that any human experience, even that which for millennium was called by the sizable portion of the human race as prophetic, or divine or enlightened, is an experience which transcends the human mind. If we define such mental practices as witnessing, awareness or stillness as spiritual, then fine. But the word “spirituality” also implies transcendental quality. And so my initial question was if you are aware of any verifiable evidence of any human being ever having such experiences?… Personally, even if I use as evidence the most noted historic testimonies, while I recognize the states of mind (often stillness and heightened awareness) I do not see any evidence from the essence of their teachings of anything more than that. Do you? Giovanni Dienstmann It’s a delicate case, because you are looking for objetive/physical evidence for things that are only known subjectively, by some people. Science can measure the brain waves and see that something different is going on, but that’s about it. What I feel is that experience with these subjects (which doesn’t come easily, necessarily) will speak volumes against our natural skepticism. Until that comes, you can simply continue practicing meditation for its already demonstrated benefits, and researching about this topic for exploration. You can be pragmatic about it, and follow what makes you a better person, and happier – regardless of already existing any scientific evidence of it or not. All we know is known through the mind – even the “transcendental”. Knowledge always implies duality (subject and object). And if there is duality, the mind can register it, and there might be some effect on the brain about it. So if your measure of transcendence is the fact that the mind cannot know it… well, then how can you know that you (or anyone) has experienced it? It seems that the reality and effects of spiritual experiences will remain outside of the formal field of science for at least some more decades. Just like the neurological benefits of meditation were unproven by science 50 years ago, albeit real. Having said that, I read in the book Yoga Psychology about clinical cases where people that had been declared dead (brain dead) were “floating over their body, and observing the doctors”. Once the person “resuscitated” he correctly reported all that the doctors had said after his “death”. That would show that our mind is more than our brain, and exists independently from our body. I would expect that things like this will become more common, as the science opens up more to explore the “spiritual” and “paranormal”. tedon Thank you for your reply. I share your general views on the limitations of science. However science is catching up fast, perhaps too fast in some cases. For example, a best-selling author E. Tolle (like many mystics of the past) attributed his Observer Being (by asking “Who am I watching self?”) to some transcendental consciousness beyond the mind, while science already knows that it is a function of the brain. So science is rapidly closing gap on many mystical ideas. In fact, a pioneering science is increasingly going ahead of most human philosophies and insights. For example, new age authors likes Chopra are trying to use most recent scientific hypothesis and research to revamp their ideologies creating some synthesis of pseudo-scientific and spiritual ideas. Unfortunately for readers, science often disproves itself leaving these works with highly questionable claims of the “Truth”…Btw, the examples of out-of-body experiences can be attributed to brain functioning because as long as there is a supply of blood to the brain, it is not “dead”. As once inventor of MRI and CT technologies, I believe a brain field exists even when the brain is clinically dead and it is not beyond the field of scientific explanation. None what I say denies existence of underlined consciousness which transcends the human mind. However I had not seen any credible evidence of it in any testimonies or in writings even of the greatest sages of all time. I see lots of worldly wisdom in their teachings, highly useful in many circumstances, but also mistaken in some matters. For example, Buddha’s ideas of Universal creation were fairly recently proven to be mistaken, while the Biblical 6-day creation story was disproved centuries ago. These sages were great humans, with awareness well ahead of mass awareness of their times, and their practice of awareness clearly played a key role in that. So happy meditating! And thank you for a discussion. Giovanni Dienstmann Yes, I don’t see any harm in this way of thinking. At the end of the day, most of us seek spirituality to live better, not necessarily to understand all the mysteries of the universe. I believe science can start probing the spiritual mysteries more actively, so long it leaves behind the metaphysical assumption of materialism in its worldview. Judging from what you wrote, it seems to me you have done that already. Shailaja Baunthiyal Awesome post. Loved the simplicity of it.

Spirituality says that even if you think you’re limited and small, it simply isn’t so. You’re greater and more powerful than you have ever imagined. A great and divine light exists inside of you. This same light is also in everyone you know and in everyone you will ever know in the future. You may think you’re limited to just your physical body and state of affairs — including your gender, race, family, job, and status in life — but spirituality comes in and says “there is more than this.” Notice that spirit sounds similar to words like inspire and expire . This is especially appropriate because when you’re filled with spiritual energy, you feel great inspiration, and when the spiritual life force leaves your body, your time on this earth expires. These are two of the main themes of the spiritual journey: Allowing yourself to be filled with inspiration, which also translates into love, joy, wisdom, peacefulness, and service. Remembering that an inevitable expiration awaits to take you away from the very circumstances you may think are so very important right now. The study of spirituality goes deeply into the heart of every matter and extends far beyond the physical world of matter. Spirituality connects you with the profoundly powerful and divine force that’s present in this universe. Whether you’re looking for worldly success, inner peace, or supreme enlightenment, no knowledge can propel you to achieve your goals and provide as effective a plan for living as does spiritual knowledge. Going beyond the physical world Perhaps the best way to think about a spiritual approach to the world is to contrast it with a more common materialistic approach. The materialistic approach: The materialistic approach relies primarily on empirical evidence provided by the five senses — what can literally be seen, heard, tasted, touched, or smelled. This approach depends on the outer appearances of things to decide how and what to think and feel about them. A materialistic person fixes whatever may be wrong or out of place in his or her world by moving things around and effecting outer changes. The spiritual approach: In contrast, the spiritual way is to see beyond mere outer appearances and the five senses to an intuitive perception of the causes behind outer conditions. Someone with a spiritual approach may change and uplift their world by first transforming and improving his or her own vision. One of the main teachings of spirituality is to look within and find what you seek within yourself. The external world is ephemeral, temporary, and ever changing; in fact, your body will die one day, sweeping all those worldly accoutrements away like a mere pile of dust. Your inner realm, on the other hand, is timeless, eternal, and deeply profound. Knowing how spirituality differs from religion Although religion and spirituality are sometimes used interchangeably, they really indicate two different aspects of the human experience. You might say that spirituality is the mystical face of religion. Spirituality is the wellspring of divinity that pulsates, dances, and flows as the source and essence of every soul. Spirituality relates more to your personal search, to finding greater meaning and purpose in your existence. Some elements of spirituality include the following: • Looking beyond outer appearances to the deeper significance and soul of everything • Love and respect for God • Love and respect for yourself • Love and respect for everybody Religion is most often used to describe an organized group or culture that has generally been sparked by the fire of a spiritual or divine soul. Religions usually act with a mission and intention of presenting specific teachings and doctrines while nurturing and propagating a particular way of life. Religion and spirituality can blend beautifully Different religions can look quite unlike one another. Some participants bow to colorful statues of deities, others listen to inspired sermons while dressed in their Sunday finery, and yet others set out their prayer rugs five times a day to bow their heads to the ground. Regardless of these different outer manifestations of worship, the kernel of religion is spirituality, and the essence of spirituality is God or the Supreme Being. Spirituality is: Beyond all religions yet containing all religions Beyond all science yet containing all science Beyond all philosophy yet containing all philosophy As one becomes more spiritual, animalistic aggressions of fighting and trying to control the beliefs of other people can be cast off like an old set of clothes that no longer fits. In fact, many seekers begin to feel that every image of divinity is just one more face of their own, eternally ever-present God. Loving and respecting all religions and images of God doesn’t mean that you have to agree with all their doctrines. In fact, you don’t even have to believe and agree with every element and doctrine of your own religion! This goes for any teachings you may encounter along your path. Everybody thinks that what they are doing is right. That’s what’s so fun about the world. Everybody is doing something different, and each one believes deep in his soul that what he believes is right — some with more contemplation and conviction than others. "

55," Network of Spiritual Progressives — NSP members and leaders believe the progressive world needs a spiritual political movement. We use the word ""spiritual"" to include all those whose deepest values lead them to challenge the ethos of selfishness and materialism that has led people into a frantic search for money and power and away from a life that places love, kindness, generosity, peace, non-violence, social justice, awe and wonder at the grandeur of creation, thanksgiving, humility and joy at the center of our lives.

The Network of Spiritual Progressives — the interfaith advocacy arm of Tikkun magazine — seeks to transform our materialist and corporate-dominated society into a caring society through consciousness raising, advocacy, and public awareness campaigns that promote a “ New Bottom Line ” based on generos ity, peace, and social transformation. The NSP shifts mass consciousness by challenging status-quo ideas about what is possible. Founded in 2005 by Tikkun Editor Michael Lerner, Benedictine Sister Joan Chittister, and Princeton University Professor Cornel West (author of Race Matters ), the NSP has current campaigns for a Global Marshall Plan and for an Environmental and Social Responsibility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The NSP is not only for members of religious communities but also for people who do not believe in God or do not associate with any religion but do realize the need for a New Bottom Line in our world today. Listen to a Q&A with with NSP co-chair, Rabbi Michael Lerner, and the NSP’s executive director, Cat Zavis, to learn more about the NSP. Become a Member and Join Our Movement! Want to learn more about how you can get involved? Read our Starter Guide and begin your involvement today! What is Spiritual? Here’s what is spiritual: Ethics, aesthetics, love, compassion, creativity, music, altruism, generosity, forgiveness, spontaneity, emergent phenomena, consciousness itself, and any other aspect of reality not subject to empirical verification or measurement. Many scientists are also spiritual: They understand that the scientific method is appropriate for describing regularities in the natural world, but not for understanding all of reality. Those aspects of reality that cannot be reduced to publicly observable and verifiable behavior we call spiritual. What Is A Spiritual Progressive? (Hint: You don’t have to believe in God or Be Part of a Religion). YOU are a spiritual progressive if you endorse the New Bottom Line: A New Bottom Line is one that judges the efficiency, rationality, and productivity of our institutions (education, healthcare, legal, etc.), government (and its policies), corporations and even our personal behavior based not on the old bottom line of whether they maximize money and power, but instead assessing them on the extent that they maximize love and caring, kindness and generosity, empathy and compassion, social and economic justice, peace and nonviolence, and environmental sustainability, as well as encourage us to transcend a narrow utilitarian approach to nature and other human beings. You don’t have to believe in God, deny science, or be part of a religion to be a spiritual progressive. Spiritual progressives use the New Bottom Line to assess the value of our economic, political, and social arrangements and seek to do tikkun (heal and transform the world), using tactics and strategies which themselves manifest that new bottom line (e.g. nonviolence and nonviolent communication). Or to put it in a short sound byte: we support The Caring Society—Caring for Each Other and Caring for the Earth. Learn More About the NSP Order New Book Embracing Israel/Palestine is now available.

56," “I’m Spiritual, but not Religious” | The Papist The Papist Young, Catholic, Called! Know the Faith Fall In Love With God Ask A Question! Transform Culture Apologetics Corner Catholic Memes Oct 3, 2015 “I’m Spiritual, but not Religious” Mike Z Fall In Love With God faith , God , hope , love , prayer , prayer and praise , presence , Spiritual Reflections , trust 1 Comment This phrase is more and more popular these days. But what exactly does it mean? What are you implying when you say this? I was at a breakfast the other morning with a mix of younger and older religiously minded folks and this came up. When someone is asked if they are religious or what faith tradition they belong to, there is a tendency to squirm. Unless one is firmly rooted in a faith tradition that they will wear outwardly on their sleeve, they will always start with, “Well, I was raised…..” and then proceed into some diatribe about how they practice in an alternative way “get what they need” that way. I heard a couple people say this at the breakfast and was saddened. I was saddened for a couple reasons. The first that always strikes me is that many who claim this “spiritual, but not religious” tenet are ones who have been hurt by organized religion in the past. I have heard stories about mean priests, overbearing parents, and faith communities that just didn’t understand their life choices. Since their life style did not jive with those whom they were in community with, they abandoned ship to find another. Many times as well, the sting of these experiences left such a mark that they have real trouble trusting any other organized group and are only waiting for the inevitable other shoe to drop; waiting for some other instance where they do not fit in once again. I was also saddened because when they spoke of their spiritual practices, they expressed a longing for certain aspects that they felt were vital to really connecting. They spoke of individual ways in which they “feel connected” to something larger or spiritual in practices they enjoy. Usually these devolved into something athletic, such as running, yoga, or meditation. They talked about how these practices helped them delve deeper into themselves and find something. When running, they would forget they were running and do incredible distances without knowing. But, whether it was running, yoga (hot or not), or meditation, they all expressed that it was always much better when they did these activities in a group or in an organized way like a class. The others would be their encouragement and keep them on track. They would also help them feel more normal and see that others had the same struggles as they did. If they ran on their own, they would get tired and want to quit more easily. If it was meditation, they would get distracted and feel it wasn’t effective. In yoga, they would feel awkward and not do it well. (This is why workout videos never work for me at home) But what is it that they are really looking for? Community. They are looking for others on the path that can be there with them in support or solidarity. They are looking for others to lead, or others they can lead. They want their hand held at times, or perhaps a reassuring glance. Or perhaps it is just the presence of another that makes one feel reassured that we are all in this together. So I wondered why this did not work for them in organized religion? The answer came in the very same conversation. One spoke of this awe and reverence for Islam. What she liked was that they were so intentional about what they were doing when they prayed and joined together. The simplicity of their prayers and movements showed her a real connection with the divine that they were trying to reach. But why did this same effect not happen in Christianity. I believe it is the mistaken separation of Church and State. People have compartmentalized themselves so much that they do not allow the sacred to influence their daily lives. It is something only done on Sundays and that is all. Since they do not allow it to permeate the rest of their lives, their practices and efforts fall short. In reality, these prayers, services and Masses should have the spiritual effect they are looking for. When the community of believers comes together, there is real transformative power in their unified spirits. I heard them say that these written and formulaic prayers don’t feel connected to them. My immediate answer to myself was “well, you’re not doing it right then”. All of the aspects of the faith, whether it be prayer, communion, song, or something else, all should have the connection with the divine (or the “spiritual”) that they are looking for. It is right there if they cared to look. The first step is always letting go of self. Just the same as the individual running, yoga, meditation and others have fallen short when tried, and then a more desired result is found when done together, faith works much the same way. You have to humble yourself and engage in the Spirit to become involved with Him. If you put your own desires and needs first, you will not be in communion. Communion is a two way street. You have to allow it to come to you, then your efforts will bring you forward.

Web Content Display What is Spirituality? ""Spirituality is the science and the art of remembrance"" - Chariji It is the remembrance of our original home, from which we have come. We have become so focused on material life that we no longer remember that divine home. The soul is the traveller on its way back home. The journey is the life we adopt on the way home. It is life itself. The vehicle is the body in which the soul travels through life. Our spiritual goal is to achieve that original condition and the spiritual path is the way we travel to reach that goal. According to Babuji Maharaj, “Spirituality really begins where religion ends.” Spirituality is easily identifiable with mysticism. The mystic or spiritual journey is an inner journey of the heart. One of the great tenets or principles of all religions has been that God resides in the heart of the human being. Spirituality focuses attention on the divine effulgence created by the presence of divinity in the heart. Spirituality is the need for an inner existence. ( Why spirituality? ) Spirituality invokes no names, confers no attributes, demands no subservience to any artificially created gods of the human mind, and focuses our attention on the infinite, ultimate source of all beings, which is nameless, formless and attribute-less. This approach to the Ultimate can bring together people of all cultures and all religions. If widely practiced, spirituality is perhaps the most potent force for bringing about human integration.( When should spirituality start? ). ""As a bird needs two wings to fly, so a human being needs the two wings of existence, the spiritual and the material, to lead a natural and harmonious life. If either is neglected for the other, such a life becomes unnatural and the result cannot be what we desire it to be. Spirituality provides the way to restore this balance within our self."" - Chariji “Highest Bliss is located in one’s own Self.” - Mandukya Upanishad . Material life may be fulfilling to a certain extent, but it often leaves us with a feeling of emptiness, an indefinable lack of something, even if we do not know what. Most of us want joy, happiness and peace. Spirituality teaches us that real joy, happiness and peace come from within. Spirituality brings lasting and meaningful change to our lives through inner transformation. As we change, the universe changes around us. With this change, there is a nurturing of the inner qualities of the heart, such as courage, hope, faith, wonder, compassion, tolerance, and most of all, love. ( What is Sahaj Marg? ) “ Spirituality is all about preparing for change – Changing from what we are, to what we have to become. ” -Chariji “ Spirituality has to deal with the soul and the soul alone. It has nothing to do with the body; the intellect; the mind and other paraphernalia of human existence. He alone is spiritual who seeks the Ultimate consciousness or the Godly consciousness in himself, and strives to unite his personal individual consciousness with that Ultimate consciousness. ” -Chariji Masters of Sahaj Marg Practice Sahaj Marg Worldwide Literature Resources Lalaji Babuji Chariji Kamleshji Meditation Cleaning Prayer Meditation Universal Prayer Constant Remembrance Headquarters Retreat Centres CREST LMOI School Bookstore US Speeches Newsletters Research Articles Special Publication E-Books Request ID/Update Info Email Subscriptions Visiting Manapakkam Visiting Satkhol Yogic transmission or pranahuti is the Divine Energy.

In modern times the emphasis is on subjective experience of a sacred dimension [1] and the ""deepest values and meanings by which people live,"" [2] [3] often in a context separate from organized religious institutions. [4] Modern spirituality typically includes a belief in a supernatural (beyond the known and observable) realm, [5] personal growth , [6] a quest for an ultimate/sacred meaning , [7] religious experience , [8] or an encounter with one's own ""inner dimension."" [9] The meaning of spirituality has developed and expanded over time, and various connotations can be found alongside each other. [10] [11] [12] [note 1] The term ""spirituality"" originally developed within early Christianity, referring to a life oriented toward the Holy Spirit . [13] During late medieval times the meaning broadened to include mental aspects of life, while in modern times the term both spread to other religious traditions [14] and broadened to refer to a wider range of experience, including a range of esoteric traditions.

[web 1] It is derived from the Old French espirit [web 1] which comes from the Latin word spiritus ( soul , courage, vigor, breath) [web 1] and is related to spirare (to breathe). [web 1] In the Vulgate the Latin word spiritus is used to translate the Greek pneuma and Hebrew ruah . [web 1] The term ""spiritual"", matters ""concerning the spirit"", [web 2] is derived from Old French spirituel (12c.), which is derived from Latin spiritualis , which comes from spiritus or ""spirit"". [web 2] The term ""spirituality"" is derived from Middle French spiritualité , [web 3] from Late Latin ""spiritualitatem"" (nominative spiritualitas), [web 3] which is also derived from Latin spiritualis . [web 3] Definition [ edit ] There is no single, widely agreed definition of spirituality. [11] [12] [note 1] Surveys of the definition of the term, as used in scholarly research, show a broad range of definitions [10] ranging from very narrow and uni-dimensional definitions such as a personal belief in a supernatural realm [5] to broader concepts such as a quest for an ultimate/sacred meaning, [7] transcending the base/material aspects of life, and/or a sense of awe/wonderment and reverence toward the universe. A survey of reviews by McCarroll e.a. dealing with the topic of spirituality gave twenty-seven explicit definitions, among which ""there was little agreement."" [10] This causes some difficulty in trying to study spirituality systematically; i.e., it impedes both understanding and the capacity to communicate findings in a meaningful fashion. Indeed many of spirituality's core features are not unique to spirituality alone; for example German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (a famous atheist) regarded self-transcendence, asceticism and the recognition of one's connection to all as a key to ethical living (see) According to Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation which ""aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in Judaism the Torah , in Christianity there is Christ , for Buddhism , Buddha , and in Islam , Muhammad ."" [15] In modern times the emphasis is on subjective experience [1] and the ""deepest values and meanings by which people live,"" [2] [3] incorporating personal growth or transformation , usually in a context separate from organized religious institutions. [4] Houtman and Aupers suggest that modern spirituality is a blend of humanistic psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions and eastern religions. [6] Spirituality is sometimes associated with philosophical, social, or political movements such as liberalism , feminist theology , and green politics . [16] Some argue (though far from universally accepted—see those who espouse secular humanism )spirituality is intimately linked to resolving mental health issues, managing substance abuse , marital functioning, parenting , and coping . Development of the meaning of spirituality [ edit ] Classical, medieval and early modern periods [ edit ] Words translatable as 'spirituality' first began to arise in the 5th century and only entered common use toward the end of the Middle Ages. [17] In a Biblical context the term means being animated by God, [18] to be driven by the Holy Spirit , as opposed to a life which rejects this influence. [13] In the 11th century this meaning changed. Spirituality began to denote the mental aspect of life, as opposed to the material and sensual aspects of life, ""the ecclesiastical sphere of light against the dark world of matter"". [19] [note 2] In the 13th century ""spirituality"" acquired a social and psychological meaning. Socially it denoted the territory of the clergy: ""The ecclesiastical against the temporary possessions, the ecclesiastical against the secular authority, the clerical class against the secular class"" [20] [note 3] Psychologically, it denoted the realm of the inner life: ""The purity of motives, affections, intentions, inner dispositions, the psychology of the spiritual life, the analysis of the feelings"". [21] [note 4] In the 17th and 18th century a distinction was made between higher and lower forms of spirituality: ""A spiritual man is one who is Christian 'more abundantly and deeper than others'."" [21] [note 5] The word was also associated with mysticism and quietism, and acquired a negative meaning. [ citation needed ] Modern spirituality [ edit ] See also: History of Westerm esotericism and New Age Modern notions of spirituality developed throughout the 19th and 20th century, mixing Christian ideas with westen esoteric traditions and elements of Asian, especially Indian, religions. Spirituality became increasingly disconnected from traditional religious organisations and institutions. Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism [ edit ] Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field. [22] He was one of the major figures in Transcendentalism , an early 19th-century liberal Protestant movement, which was rooted in English and German Romanticism , the Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher , the skepticism of Hume , [web 4] and Neo-Platonism . [23] [24] The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion. [web 5] Following Schleiermacher, [25] an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth. [web 5] In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking. [web 5] They also endorsed universalist and Unitarianist ideas, leading to Unitarian Universalism , the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians. [web 5] [web 6] Neo-Vedanta [ edit ] Main article: Neo-Vedanta An important influence on western spirituality was Neo-Vedanta , also called neo-Hinduism [26] and Hindu Universalism , [web 7] a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and orientalism . It aims to present Hinduism as a ""homogenized ideal of Hinduism"" [27] with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine. [28] Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the 19th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity. [29] Unitarianism, and the idea of Universalism, was brought to India by missionaries, and had a major influence on neo-Hinduism via Ram Mohan Roy 's Brahmo Samaj and Brahmoism . Roy attempted to modernise and reform Hinduism, from the idea of Universalism. [30] This universalism was further popularised, and brought back to the west as neo-Vedanta, by Swami Vivekananda . [30] Theosophy, Anthroposophy, and the Perennial Philosophy [ edit ] See also: Esotericism Important early 20th century western writers who studied the phenomenon of spirituality, and their works, include William James , The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), and Rudolph Otto , especially The Idea of the Holy (1917). James' notions of ""spiritual experience"" had a further influence on the modernist streams in Asian traditions, making them even further recognisable for a western audience. [25] Another major influence on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society , which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. [29] It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta , the revival of Theravada Buddhism , and Buddhist modernism , which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism and integrated them in their religious concepts. [29] A second, related influence was Anthroposophy , whose founder, Rudolf Steiner , was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and in the ways that such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education , agriculture , and medicine . [31] [32] The influence of Asian traditions on western modern spirituality was also furthered by the Perennial Philosophy , whose main proponent Aldous Huxley was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda's Neo-Vedanta and Universalism , [33] and the spread of social welfare, education and mass travel after World War Two . ""Spiritual but not religious"" [ edit ] Main article: Spiritual but not religious After the Second World War spirituality and religion became disconnected, [21] and spirituality became more oriented on subjective experience, instead of ""attempts to place the self within a broader ontological context."" [34] A new discourse developed, in which (humanistic) psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions and eastern religions are being blended, to reach the true self by self-disclosure , free expression and meditation. [6] The distinction between the spiritual and the religious became more common in the popular mind during the late 20th century with the rise of secularism and the advent of the New Age movement. Authors such as Chris Griscom and Shirley MacLaine explored it in numerous ways in their books. Paul Heelas noted the development within New Age circles of what he called ""seminar spirituality"": [35] structured offerings complementing consumer choice with spiritual options. Among other factors, declining membership of organized religions and the growth of secularism in the western world have given rise to this broader view of spirituality. [36] Even the secular are finding use for spiritual beliefs. [37] In his books, Michael Mamas makes the case for integrating Eastern spiritual knowledge with Western rational thought. [38] [39] The term ""spiritual"" is now frequently used in contexts in which the term ""religious"" was formerly employed. [14] Both theists and atheists have criticized this development. [40] [41] Traditional spirituality [ edit ] Abrahamic faiths [ edit ] Judaism [ edit ] Rabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew: ""Yahadut Rabanit"" - ????? ?????) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the Talmud . It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah (""Law"" or ""Instruction"") cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and by the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the law (called halakha , ""the way""). Judaism knows a variety of religious observances : ethical rules, prayers, religious clothing, holidays, shabbat, pilgrimages, Torah reading, dietary laws. Kabbalah (literally ""receiving""), is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought of Judaism. Its definition varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it, [42] from its religious origin as an integral part of Judaism , to its later Christian , New Age , or Occultist syncretic adaptations. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious Ein Sof (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). While it is heavily used by some denominations, it is not a religious denomination in itself. Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation. Outside Judaism, its scriptures are read outside the traditional canons of organised religion. Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being, the nature and purpose of existence, and various other ontological questions. It also presents methods to aid understanding of these concepts and to thereby attain spiritual realisation. Hasidic Judaism , meaning ""piety"" (or "" loving kindness ""), is a branch of Orthodox Judaism that promotes spirituality through the popularisation and internalisation of Jewish mysticism as the fundamental aspect of the faith. It was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov as a reaction against overly legalistic Judaism. His example began the characteristic veneration of leadership in Hasidism as embodiments and intercessors of Divinity for the followers. [ citation needed ] Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the Immanent Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of study , and replaced historical mystical (kabbalistic) and ethical (musar) asceticism and admonishment with optimism, [ citation needed ] encouragement, and daily fervour . This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine Panentheism , through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought. Christianity [ edit ] Main articles: Catholic spirituality and Christian mysticism Union with Christ is the purpose of Christian mysticism. Catholic spirituality is the spiritual practice of living out a personal act of faith ( fides qua creditur ) following the acceptance of faith ( fides quae creditur ). Although all Catholics are expected to pray together at Mass , there are many different forms of spirituality and private prayer which have developed over the centuries. Each of the major religious orders of the Catholic Church and other lay groupings have their own unique spirituality - its own way of approaching God in prayer and in living out the Gospel . Christian mysticism refers to the development of mystical practices and theory within Christianity . It has often been connected to mystical theology , especially in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The attributes and means by which Christian mysticism is studied and practiced are varied and range from ecstatic visions of the soul's mystical union with God to simple prayerful contemplation of Holy Scripture (i.e., Lectio Divina ). Progressive Christianity is a contemporary movement which seeks to remove the supernatural claims of the faith and replace them with a post-critical understanding of biblical spirituality based on historical and scientific research. It focuses on the lived experience of spirituality over historical dogmatic claims, and accepts that the faith is both true and a human construction, and that spiritual experiences are psychologically and neurally real and useful. Islam [ edit ] Five pillars [ edit ] Main article: Five Pillars of Islam The Pillars of Islam ( arkan al-Islam ; also arkan ad-din , ""pillars of religion"") are five basic acts in Islam, considered obligatory for all believers. The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the shahadah (creed), (2) daily prayers ( salat ), (3) almsgiving ( zakah ), (4) fasting during Ramadan and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca ( hajj ) at least once in a lifetime. The Shia and Sunni sects both agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts. [43] Sufism [ edit ] Main article: Sufism The best known form of Islamic mystic spirituality is the Sufi tradition (famous through Rumi and Hafiz ) in which a spiritual master or pir transmits spiritual discipline to students. [44] Sufism or ta?awwuf ( Arabic : ????? ??) is defined by its adherents as the inner, mystical dimension of Islam . [45] [46] [47] A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a ??f? ( ??????? ). Sufis believe they are practicing ihsan (perfection of worship) as revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad , Worship and serve Allah as you are seeing Him and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you. Sufis consider themselves as the original true proponents of this pure original form of Islam. They are strong adherents to the principal of tolerance, peace and against any form of violence. The Sufi have suffered severe persecution by more rigid and fundamentalist groups such as the Wahhabi and Salafi movement . In 1843 the Senussi Sufi were forced to flee Mecca and Medina and head to Sudan and Libya. [48] Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as ""a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God"". [49] Alternatively, in the words of the Darqawi Sufi teacher Ahmad ibn Ajiba , ""a science through which one can know how to travel into the presence of the Divine , purify one's inner self from filth, and beautify it with a variety of praiseworthy traits"". [50] Jihad [ edit ] Main article: Jihad Jihad is a religious duty of Muslims . In Arabic , the word jih?d translates as a noun meaning ""struggle"". There are two commonly accepted meanings of jihad: an inner spiritual struggle and an outer physical struggle. [51] The ""greater jihad"" is the inner struggle by a believer to fulfill his religious duties. [51] [52] This non-violent meaning is stressed by both Muslim [53] and non-Muslim [54] authors. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi , an 11th-century Islamic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of Muhammad , Jabir ibn Abd-Allah : The Prophet ... returned from one of his battles, and thereupon told us, 'You have arrived with an excellent arrival, you have come from the Lesser Jihad to the Greater Jihad—the striving of a servant (of Allah ) against his desires (holy war)."" [ unreliable source? ] [55] [56] [note 6] Asian traditions [ edit ] Buddhism [ edit ] Main article: Buddhism Buddhist practices are known as Bhavana , which literally means ""development"" or ""cultivating"" [57] or ""producing"" [58] [59] in the sense of ""calling into existence."" [60] It is an important concept in Buddhist praxis ( Patipatti ). The word bhavana normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as citta-bhavana (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or metta-bhavana (the development/cultivation of lovingkindness). When used on its own bhavana signifies 'spiritual cultivation' generally. Various Buddhist Paths to liberation developed throughout the ages. Best-known is the Noble Eightfold Path , but others include the Bodhisattva Path and Lamrim . Hinduism [ edit ] Main article: Hinduism Jñ?na marga Bhakti marga R?ja marga Three of four paths of spirituality in Hinduism Hinduism has no traditional ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monistic, or atheistic. [61] Within this diffuse and open structure, spirituality in Hindu philosophy is an individual experience, and referred to as ksaitrajña (Sanskrit: ?????????? [62] ). It defines spiritual practice as one's journey towards moksha , awareness of self, the discovery of higher truths, true nature of reality, and a consciousness that is liberated and content. [63] [64] Four paths [ edit ] Traditionally, Hinduism identifies three m?rga (ways) [65] [note 7] of spiritual practice, [66] namely Jñ?na , the way of knowledge; Bhakti , the way of devotion; and Karma yoga , the way of selfless action. In the 19th century Vivekananda , in his neo-Vedanta synthesis of Hinduism, added R?ja yoga , the way of contemplation and meditation, as a fourth way, calling all of them ""yoga."" [67] [note 8] Jñ?na marga is a path often assisted by a guru (teacher) in one's spiritual practice. [69] Bhakti marga is a path of faith and devotion to deity or deities; the spiritual practice often includes chanting, singing and music - such as in kirtans - in front of idols, or images of one or more deity, or a devotional symbol of the holy. [70] Karma marga is the path of one's work, where diligent practical work or vartta (Sanskrit: ????????, profession) becomes in itself a spiritual practice, and work in daily life is perfected as a form of spiritual liberation and not for its material rewards. [71] [72] R?ja marga is the path of cultivating necessary virtues, self-discipline, tapas (meditation), contemplation and self-reflection sometimes with isolation and renunciation of the world, to a pinnacle state called sam?dhi . [73] [74] This state of sam?dhi has been compared to peak experience. [75] There is a rigorous debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, Chandogyopanishad suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in tapas will succeed; Svetasvataropanishad suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires a longing for truth, but warns of becoming 'false ascetic' who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating on the nature of Self and universal Truths. [76] In the practice of Hinduism, suggest modern era scholars such as Vivekananda , the choice between the paths is up to the individual and a person's proclivities. [64] [77] Other scholars [78] suggest that these Hindu spiritual practices are not mutually exclusive, but overlapping. These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in Balinese Hinduism , where it is called Catur Marga (literally: four paths). [79] Schools and spirituality [ edit ] Different schools of Hinduism encourage different spiritual practices. In Tantric school for example, the spiritual practice has been referred to as s?dhan? . It involves initiation into the school, undergoing rituals, and achieving moksha liberation by experiencing union of cosmic polarities. [80] The Hare Krishna school emphasizes bhakti yoga as spiritual practice. [81] In Advaita Vedanta school, the spiritual practice emphasizes jñ?na yoga in stages: samnyasa (cultivate virtues), sravana (hear, study), manana (reflect) and dhyana (nididhyasana, contemplate). [82] Sikhism [ edit ] Main article: Sikhism An 18th Century Sikh Raja Sikhism considers spiritual life and secular life to be intertwined: [83] ""In the Sikh Weltanschauung...the temporal world is part of the Infinite Reality and partakes of its characteristics."" [84] Guru Nanak described living an ""active, creative, and practical life"" of ""truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity"" as being higher than a purely contemplative life. [85] The 6th Sikh Guru Guru Hargobind re-affirmed that the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms are mutually coexistent. [86] According to the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadhur, the ideal Sikh should have both Shakti (power that resides in the temporal), and Bhakti (spiritual meditative qualities). This was developed into the concept of the Saint Soldier by the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh. [87] According to Guru Nanak , the goal is to attain the ""attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life"", [88] the polar opposite to a self-centered existence. [88] Nanak talks further about the one God or Akal (timelessness) that permeates all life [89] ). [90] [91] [92] and which must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being. [93] In Sikhism there is no dogma , [94] priests , monastics or yogis . African spirituality [ edit ] Main article: Traditional African religion In some African contexts, spirituality is considered a belief system that guides the welfare of society and the people therein, and eradicates sources of unhappiness occasioned by evil. Contemporary spirituality [ edit ] See also: New Age The term ""spiritual"" is now frequently used in contexts in which the term ""religious"" was formerly employed. [14] Contemporary spirituality is also called ""post-traditional spirituality"" and "" New Age spirituality"". [95] Hanegraaf makes a distinction between two ""New Age"" movements: New Age in a restricted sense, which originated primarily in mid-twentieth century England and had its roots in Theosophy and Anthroposophy , and ""New Age"" in a general sense, which emerged in the later 1970s when increasing numbers of people ... began to perceive a broad similarity between a wide variety of ""alternative ideas"" and pursuits, and started to think of them as part of one ""movement"""". [96] Those who speak of spirituality outside of religion often define themselves as spiritual but not religious and generally believe in the existence of different ""spiritual paths,"" emphasizing the importance of finding one's own individual path to spirituality. According to one 2005 poll, about 24% of the United States population identifies itself as spiritual but not religious. [web 8] Characteristics [ edit ] Modern spirituality is centered on the ""deepest values and meanings by which people live."" [97] It embraces the idea of an ultimate or an alleged immaterial reality . [98] It envisions an inner path enabling a person to discover the essence of his/her being. Not all modern notions of spirituality embrace transcendental ideas. Secular spirituality emphasizes humanistic ideas on moral character (qualities such as love, compassion , patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, responsibility, harmony, and a concern for others). [99] :22 These are aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialist view of the world without necessarily accepting belief in a supernatural reality or divine being. Nevertheless, many humanists (e.g. Bertrand Russell ) who clearly value the non-material, communal and virtuous aspects of life reject this usage of the term spirituality as being overly-broad (i.e. it effectively amounts to saying ""everything and anything that is good and virtuous is necessarily spiritual"") [100] Similarly, Aristotle—one of the first known Western thinkers to demonstrate that morality, virtue and goodness can be derived without appealing to supernatural forces—even argued that ""men create Gods in their own image"" (not the other way around). Moreover, theistic and atheistic critics alike dismiss the need for the ""secular spirituality"" label on the basis that i) the term ""spirit"" is commonly taken as denoting the existence of unseen / otherworldly / life-giving forces and ii) words such as morality, philanthropy and humanism already efficiently and succinctly describe the prosocial-orientation and civility that the phrase secular spirituality is meant to convey but without risk of potential confusion that one is referring to something supernatural. Although personal well-being, both physical and psychological , is said to be an important aspect of modern spirituality, this does not imply spirituality is essential to achieving happiness (e.g. see ). Free-thinkers who reject notions that the numinous/non-material is important to living well can be just as happy as more spiritually-oriented individuals ( see ) [101] Contemporary spirituality theorists assert that spirituality develops inner peace and forms a foundation for happiness . For example, Meditation and similar practices are suggested to help practitioners cultivate his or her inner life and character. [102] [ unreliable source? ] [103] Ellison and Fan (2008) assert that spirituality causes a wide array of positive health outcomes, including ""morale, happiness, and life satisfaction."". [104] However, Schuurmans-Stekhoven (2013) actively attempted to replicate this research and found more ""mixed"" results. [105] Nevertheless, spirituality has played a central role in self-help movements such as Alcoholics Anonymous : if an alcoholic failed to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life through work and self-sacrifice for others, he could not survive the certain trials and low spots ahead [106] Spiritual experience [ edit ] Main article: Religious experience ""Spiritual experience"" plays a central role in modern spirituality. [107] This notion has been popularised by both western and Asian authors. [108] [109] William James popularized the use of the term ""religious experience"" in his The Varieties of Religious Experience. [108] It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge. [web 9] Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of ""religious experience"" further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of ""religious experience"" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential. [110] Major Asian influences were Vivekananda [111] and D.T. Suzuki. [107] Swami Vivekananda popularised a modern syncretitistic Hinduism, [112] [109] in which the authority of the scriptures was replaced by an emphasis on personal experience. [109] [113] D.T. Suzuki had a major influence on the popularisation of Zen in the west and popularized the idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality. [web 10] [web 11] [29] Another example can be seen in Paul Brunton 's A Search in Secret India , which introduced Ramana Maharshi and Meher Baba to a western audience. Spiritual experiences can include being connected to a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive self ; joining with other individuals or the human community ; with nature or the cosmos ; or with the divine realm. [114] Spiritual practices [ edit ] Main article: Spiritual practice Waaijman discerns four forms of spiritual practices: [115] Somatic practices, especially deprivation and diminishment. Deprivation aims to purify the body. Diminishment concerns the repulsement of ego-oriented impulses. Examples include fasting and poverty. [115] Psychological practices, for example meditation. [116] Social practices. Examples include the practice of obedience and communal ownership, reforming ego-orientedness into other-orientedness. [116] Spiritual. All practices aim at purifying ego-centeredness, and direct the abilities at the divine reality. [116] Spiritual practices may include meditation , mindfulness , prayer , the contemplation of sacred texts , ethical development, [99] and the use of psychoactive substances ( entheogens ). Love and/or compassion are often [ quantify ] described as the mainstay of spiritual development. [99] Within spirituality is also found ""a common emphasis on the value of thoughtfulness, tolerance for breadth and practices and beliefs, and appreciation for the insights of other religious communities, as well as other sources of authority within the social sciences."" [117] Science [ edit ] Antagonism [ edit ] Since the scientific revolution , the relationship of science to religion and spirituality has developed in complex ways. [118] [119] Historian John Hedley Brooke describes wide variations: The natural sciences have been invested with religious meaning, with antireligious implications and, in many contexts, with no religious significance at all."" [119] It has been proposed that the currently held popular notion of antagonisms between science and religion [120] [121] has historically originated with ""thinkers with a social or political axe to grind"" rather than with the natural philosophers themselves. [119] Though physical and biological scientists today avoid supernatural explanations to describe reality [122] [123] [124] [note 9] , some scientists continue to consider science and spirituality to be complementary, not contradictory, [125] [126] and are willing to debate. [127] A few religious leaders have also shown openness to modern science and its methods. The 14th Dalai Lama has proposed that if a scientific analysis conclusively showed certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then the claims must be abandoned and the findings of science accepted. [128] Holism [ edit ] Main article: Holism During the twentieth century the relationship between science and spirituality has been influenced both by Freudian psychology, which has accentuated the boundaries between the two areas by accentuating individualism and secularism, and by developments in particle physics , which reopened the debate about complementarity between scientific and religious discourse and rekindled for many an interest in holistic conceptions of reality. [119] :322 These holistic conceptions were championed by New Age spiritualists in a type of quantum mysticism that they claim justifies their spiritual beliefs, [129] [130] though quantum physicists themselves on the whole reject such attempts as being pseudoscientific . [131] [132] Scientific research [ edit ] Health and well-being [ edit ] Various studies have reported a positive correlation between spirituality and mental well-being in both healthy people and those encountering a range of physical illnesses or psychological disorders. [133] [134] [135] [136] Spiritual individuals tend to be optimistic, report greater social support, [137] and experience higher intrinsic meaning in life , [138] strength, and inner peace . [139] Whether the correlation of spirituality with positive psychological factors represents a causal link remains contentious. Both supporters and opponents of this claim agree that past statistical findings are difficult to interpret, in large part because of the ongoing disagreement over how spirituality should be defined and measured. [140] There is also evidence that an agreeable / positive temperament and/or a tendency toward sociability (which both correlate with spirituality) might actually be the key psychological features that predispose people to subsequently adopt a spiritual orientation and that these characteristics, not spiritually per se , add to well-being. There is also some suggestion that the benefits associated with spirituality and religiosity might arise from being a member of a close-knit community. Social bonds available via secular sources (i.e., not unique to spirituality or faith-based groups) might just as effectively raise well-being. In sum, spiritual may not be the ""active ingredient"" (i.e. past association with psychological well-being measures might reflect a reverse causation or effects from other variables that correlate with spirituality), [100] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] and that the effects of agreeableness, conscientiousness, or virtue—personality traits common in many non-spiritual people yet known to be slightly more common among the spiritual—may better account for spirituality's apparent correlation with mental health and social support. [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] Intercessionary prayer [ edit ] Masters and Spielmans [152] conducted a meta-analysis of all the available and reputable research examining the effects of distant intercessory prayer. They found no discernible health effects from being prayed for by others. Spiritual experiences [ edit ] Neuroscientists have examined brain functioning during reported spiritual experiences [153] [154] finding that certain neurotransmitters and specific areas of the brain are involved. [155] [156] [157] [158] Moreover, experimenters have also successfully induced spiritual experiences in individuals by administering psychoactive agents known to elicit euphoria and perceptual distortions. [159] [160] Conversely, religiosity and spirituality can also be dampened by electromagnetic stimulation of the brain. [161] These results have motivated some leading theorists to speculate that spirituality may be a benign subtype of psychosis ( see ). [142] [162] [163] [164] [165] Benign in the sense that the same aberrant sensory perceptions that those suffering clinical psychoses evaluate as distressingly in-congruent and inexplicable are instead interpreted by spiritual individuals as positive—as personal and meaningful transcendent experiences. [163] [164] Spiritual care in health care professions [ edit ] In the health care professions there is growing interest in ""spiritual care,"" to complement the medical-technical approaches and improve the outcomes of medical treatments. [166] [167] For example, Puchalski et al., who argue for "" compassionate systems of care,"" offering the following definition of spirituality in the operationalization of spiritual care: Spirituality is a dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity through which persons seek ultimate meaning, purpose, and transcendence, and experience relationship to self, family, others, community, society, nature, and the significant or sacred. Spirituality is expressed through beliefs, values, traditions, and practices. [167] However, again the problem here is that numerous atheists such as Arthur Schopenhauer , Bertrand Russell , A.C. Grayling and Aristotle who would personally recoil at being labelled spiritual or believers in the supernatural would nevertheless still endorse the pursuit of meaning and purpose and personal efforts to transcend the self. Put frankly, those who term themselves spiritual do not have a monopoly on either compassion or civility. [168] Once the views of such humanist philosophers and the results from psychological surveys are accepted spirituality seems to boil down to a label given to a particular sub-type from among the broader set of compassionate/civil people.

The Purana suggests that ""true knowledge of nature"" leads to ""true knowledge of Self and God."" It illustrates 24 gurus that nature provides. For example, earth teaches steadfastness and the wisdom that all things while pursuing their own activities, do nothing but follow the divine laws that are universally established; another wisdom from earth is her example of accepting the good and bad from everyone. Another guru, the honeybee teaches that one must make effort to gain knowledge, a willingness and flexibility to examine, pick and collect essence from different scriptures and sources. And so on. Nature is a mirror image of spirit, perceptive awareness of nature can be spirituality. ^ Vivekananda, S.

61," High-flying women lose money in secret spiritual movement with 'hallmarks of pyramid scheme' | Stuff.co.nz National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out national Search NZ earthquake Crime Politics Science Education Health 1 NEWS NOW Weather Quizzes Environment Oddstuff Women of Influence High-flying women lose money in secret spiritual movement with 'hallmarks of pyramid scheme' KELLY DENNETT Last updated 10:50, December 4 2016 MARTIN DE RUYTER/FAIRFAX NZ Fran Halford of Nelson talks about why she is speaking out about Circle. New Zealand women are losing thousands of dollars to so-called women's gifting circles that purport to offer friendship and spiritual guidance but have all the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme. The Commerce Commission is warning women to steer clear of the circles, which claim to be women's empowerment groups that have the power to transform lives. The leaders invite women to make a one-off gift ranging from US$1500 to $5000, and when eight women are eventually recruited the leader of the group can take the entire cash gift. If they are unable to recruit others the groups can collapse. Soreya James says gifting circles transform lives. About 100 New Zealand women are known to have been conscripted, under strict instructions to keep it ""private"". Some have been able to live off the proceeds of the gifting; others have been left thousands of dollars out of pocket and considering legal action. READ MORE: * Spiritually transmitted disease – the poison lotus * 'Naive' investors claim $650,000 lost to suspected Ponzi ? * Is Herbalife a pyramid scheme? Billionaires at odds over the question The Commerce Commission confirmed it has received four complaints about gifting circles. Stuff has published a three-month investigation into the circles by journalist Anke Richter . David White Once she learned more about Circle, Kattia Wong decided she no longer wanted to be part of it. Numerous former members of the circle have identified self-proclaimed wellness expert Soreya James (also known as Sheree Carbery) as being at the centre of the circles. James, 45, was one of the first women to join the circle, when it came to New Zealand more than three years ago. In that time she has completed five circles, but says rumours she lives off the proceeds are exaggerated. Persuaded to speak publicly for the first time, she said she had received less than $100,000 from the circles. MARTIN DE RUYTER / FAIRFAX NZ Fran Halford, a Nelson doctor,has spoken out about the Lotus women's gifting circles, likened to a pyramid scheme. In an interview at her unpretentious Mt Maunganui apartment, James said she lived modestly and at times had been on a benefit or living ""hand to mouth"" to make ends meet. ""Women have perceived that I have received a lot more than I have ... There have been times where I have received, but I have also given a lot in this work. I've backed quite a few women and I've gifted other women. Ad Feedback ""The money I've received from this is to support my family in a time of need, it's not like I've bought an apartment. Financially I'm not struggling, but I'm not wealthy by any means."" ""This supports women to live a much more abundant lifestyle and still do what they love to do – write their books or create their music,"" she continued. ""Conceptually, women understand giving and receiving. That's who we are, that's our nature. Men understand paying for things and investing in things."" ""This is not a pyramid scheme because a pyramid scheme is when somebody receives more and more and more money at the top … and the people at the bottom really struggle. ""But there's nobody at the top, there's no hierarchy. There's no leader, there's no organisation, there's no management, and there's no woman anywhere, collectively, that is receiving more money than anybody else, and that's the difference."" Women who have escaped the circles have a different story. ""It's a spiritually-transmitted disease,"" Fran Halford told Richter. The Nelson doctor was told she would enter a circle as a Seed, then move on to Sapling, then Blossom and finally be a Lotus herself to receive her gift of US$40,000 (NZ$56,000) from eight new women, plus coaching and sisterly support on the weekly group calls online. Halford was urged to keep it private, especially from men, and told not to read anything online about the circles. ""They had this evangelical glow and chased me hard. I trusted them."" She took out a bank loan to join a circle. She lost it all, but is more disappointed at her own gullibility. Another woman, 45-year-old Auckland fashion designer Kattia Wong, decided to walk away from her circle and her money after reading criticisms online. ""I was so stressed I couldn't sleep,"" she told Richter. ""They are twisting spirituality for personal gain. They have lied to me by saying it is legal and not a pyramid scheme. Many women would not join in the first place if they knew the truth."" The Commerce Commission says the gifting circles have the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme. The Commission was aware of at least one circle that required a $5000 buy-in, competition general manager Antonia Horrocks said. ""Gifting circles first emerged in North America and are reported to have operated as pyramid schemes. We haven't investigated the New Zealand incarnations at this time and we don't have information to suggest these circles are common or widespread,"" Horrocks said. ""However, we strongly advise New Zealanders not join up. Hallmarks of pyramid schemes are that they require continued recruitment of new members, who have to pay to join, and there is an expectation members will eventually profit from being involved. These schemes collapse and those at the bottom lose their money. In addition, anyone operating or promoting a pyramid scheme risks prosecution."" Although the Commission has received complaints they were not investigating the circles. Most women spoken to who had been part of a circle asked not to be named because they were embarrassed and fearful of the repercussions of their name being associated with the circles, and expected a backlash from the women who had been successful at them. Others felt guilty that women who had scraped their money together as a gift, were later left penniless. One Auckland professional, a manager, was considering consulting a lawyer after losing US$5000 to a circle leader. The woman had backed out of the circle but the leader had made tens of thousands of dollars off the group. She warned women to do their research if they were invited into a group. ""I would say look, this happened to me, and I wouldn't recommend that to you. If you research it more thoroughly you will find it will fall over and people will lose out,"" she said. ""I would say it's a bad investment but a good learning experience. I met some good people, but I'm not sure if it was worth that much money."" James insisted she felt a sense of responsibility to the women who had lost money in the scheme, but said those women wrongly believed the circle was an investment. She said it was women who were focused on the financial benefit rather than the personal gain who often lost out.

Happily, I may say that I utter nothing but the thoughts and the wishes of the King of Israel himself; for though the times may call for some slight changes, yet does this version which we use in the colonies of New England so much exceed all other versions, that, by its richness, its exactness, and its spiritual simplicity, it approacheth, as near as may be, to the great work of the inspired writer.

View in context I could have given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presby- terian without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spirit- ual complexion, angularities, and stature of the indi- vidual who wears it; and, besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power, the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought.

Home Vision Integral Yoga Visionary - Sri Aurobindo Visit & Stay Volunteer & Intern Workshops & Therapies Join Auroville Last updated: Aug 13, 2014 Sri Aurobindo's teaching and spiritual method Sri Aurobindo Sri Aurobindo's advanced world vision, the backbone of Auroville, takes one up in wider areas of self, of life, of other. The spiritual path - or sadhana - as developed by him, works with a combination of a voluntarily adopted psychological discipline and various yogic practices. Already a century ago he declared ""All life is Yoga"". The text here below was written by Sri Aurobindo himself, in 1934. Sri Aurobindo's teaching and method of Sadhana The teaching of Sri Aurobindo starts from that of the ancient sages of India that behind the appearances of the universe there is the Reality of a Being and Consciousness, a Self of all things, one and eternal. All beings are united in that One Self and Spirit but divided by a certain separativity of consciousness, an ignorance of their true Self and Reality in the mind, life and body. It is possible by a certain psychological discipline to remove this veil of separative consciousness and become aware of the true Self, the Divinity within us and all. Sri Aurobindo's teaching states that this One Being and Consciousness is involved here in Matter. Evolution is the method by which it liberates itself; consciousness appears in what seems to be inconscient, and once having appeared is self-impelled to grow higher and higher and at the same time to enlarge and develop towards a greater and greater perfection. Life is the first step of this release of consciousness; mind is the second; but the evolution does not finish with mind, it awaits a release into something greater, a consciousness which is spiritual and supramental. The next step of the evolution must be towards the development of Supermind and Spirit as the dominant power in the conscious being. For only then will the involved Divinity in things release itself entirely and it become possible for life to manifest perfection. But while the former steps in evolution were taken by Nature without a conscious will in the plant and animal life, in man Nature becomes able to evolve by a conscious will in the instrument. It is not, however, by the mental will in man that this can be wholly done, for the mind goes only to a certain point and after that can only move in a circle. A conversion has to be made, a turning of the consciousness by which mind has to change into the higher principle. This method is to be found through the ancient psychological discipline and practice of Yoga. In the past, it has been attempted by a drawing away from the world and a disappearance into the height of the Self or Spirit. Sri Aurobindo teaches that a descent of the higher principle is possible which will not merely release the spiritual Self out of the world, but release it in the world, replace the mind's ignorance or its very limited knowledge by a supramental Truth-Consciousness which will be a sufficient instrument of the inner Self and make it possible for the human being to find himself dynamically as well as inwardly and grow out of his still animal humanity into a diviner race. The psychological discipline of Yoga can be used to that end by opening all the parts of the being to a conversion or transformation through the descent and working of the higher still concealed supramental principle. This, however, cannot be done at once or in a short time or by any rapid or miraculous transformation. Many steps have to be taken by the seeker before the supramental descent is possible. Man lives mostly in his surface mind, life and body, but there is an inner being within him with greater possibilities to which he has to awake - for it is only a very restricted influence from it that he receives now and that pushes him to a constant pursuit of a greater beauty, harmony, power and knowledge. The first process of Yoga is therefore to open the ranges of this inner being and to live from there outward, governing his outward life by an inner light and force. In doing so he discovers in himself his true soul which is not this outer mixture of mental, vital and physical elements but something of the Reality behind them, a spark from the one Divine Fire. He has to learn to live in his soul and purify and orientate by its drive towards the Truth the rest of the nature. There can follow afterwards an opening upward and descent of a higher principle of the Being. But even then it is not at once the full supramental Light and Force. For there are several ranges of consciousness between the ordinary human mind and the supramental Truth-Consciousness. These intervening ranges have to be opened up and their power brought down into the mind, life and body. Only afterwards can the full power of the Truth-Consciousness work in the nature. The process of this self-discipline or Sadhana is therefore long and difficult, but even a little of it is so much gained because it makes the ultimate release and perfection more possible. There are many things belonging to older systems that are necessary on the way - an opening of the mind to a greater wideness and to the sense of the Self and the Infinite, an emergence into what has been called the cosmic consciousness, mastery over the desires and passions; an outward asceticism is not essential, but the conquest of desire and attachment and a control over the body and its needs, greeds and instincts are indispensable. There is a combination of the principles of the old systems, the way of knowledge through the mind's discernment between Reality and the appearance, the heart's way of devotion, love and surrender and the way of works turning the will away from motives of self-interest to the Truth and the service of a greater Reality than the ego. For the whole being has to be trained so that it can respond and be transformed when it is possible for that greater Light and Force to work in the nature. In this discipline, the inspiration of the Master, and in the difficult stages his control and his presence are indispensable - for it would be impossible otherwise to go through it without much stumbling and error which would prevent all chance of success. The Master is one who has risen to a higher consciousness and being and he is often regarded as its manifestation or representative. He not only helps by his teaching and still more by his influence and example but by a power to communicate his own experience to others. This is Sri Aurobindo's teaching and method of practice. It is not his object to develop any one religion or to amalgamate the older religions or to found any new religion - for any of these things would lead away from his central purpose. The one aim of his Yoga is an inner self-development by which each one who follows it can in time discover the One Self in all and evolve a higher consciousness than the mental, a spiritual and supramental consciousness which will transform and divinise human nature.

Wanderer, Ph.D, Contributor Waking Times We are all on a spiritual journey. For everybody, this journey starts with birth and ends with death. Our life is a link between our date of birth and date of death. A link that contains all the secrets, dramas, tragedies and comedies of our lives, and we are all abandoned in this performance that we tend to forget who we are in reality. Sometimes in our quest for spiritual clarity we seek out advice from other people who can ready our spiritual energy like the advice of online psychics . Especially for those who have only started their own spiritual journey because not all have the ability to connect your current to your future. Advises from experts get you to your spiritual journey with more ease and guide to make the right decisions. Finding your soul purpose can be a very long and wasteful endeavor if you are not guided properly that is why this kind of experts can help get there faster. The book of our life stretches between the two end points, and this book is the chronicle of our wanderings. The track of our wanderings is defined and determined by our thoughts, ideas, desires and our willingness and readiness to meet the expectations. The story of these wanderings, this personal history may be infinitely varied at an individual level. Breaking through the different heights and abysmal depths along the route in the world of shapes and forms may provide the individual spiritual Seeker with endless joy and immeasurable sorrow. By identifying with our personal history written in the world of shapes and forms we experience ourselves as individuals different from everybody else. Some people, a small fragment of mankind are, however, able to identify with their own respective personal histories to a lesser and lesser degree. Under certain circumstances they recognize that this Journey along the road is aimless, they are led around and around in various landscapes of the world of shapes and forms. From life to life we chase the same ideas and desires. We have recognized that we are suffering, we are suffocated in the swamp of the multitude of beliefs and ideas, and this recognition spurs us to embark on a Journey to discover ourselves. Understanding all this is the beginning of the real JOURNEY along the road. This journey will eventually lead us out of the world of forms and shapes, back into the realm of Consciousness, free from any identification with forms and shapes. Motivations for Embarking on the Journey What may motivate somebody to step on the road and start a journey, to exist in the “here and now,” to leave behind and abandon thoughts and mind ? There may be two reasons for someone to start the Journey. One of the reasons is real, deep suffering , when the spiritual Seeker recognizes the source of suffering, the mind and its functions , and is willing to give up everything (including Ego) in order to escape from suffering (that is what happened, for instance, with Eckhart Tolle). The other factor leading one towards the Journey is intuitive knowledge, that is, when the individual reaches beyond mind spontaneously, without suffering, and recognizes the operating mechanisms of the human mind. That knowledge is in itself, however, not sufficient. There has to be a deep, internal attraction that draws the individual towards the Silence. Sometimes that attraction is referred to as primeval memory (that is what happened to Ramana Maharshi). All other reasons that may urge people to start the Journey are derived from the Ego, so these are rather parts of the journey taking one around and around in the world of shapes and forms than the beginning of the real Journey. One such reson can be is “affectation.” In that case, the wanderer is attempting to escape from suffering itself, but not from its roots and reasons. For the individual, staying in the Presence only serves as a method helping them to achieve a future, better and more beautiful (that is, free of suffering) state. Another reason rooted in the mind is the endeavour to achieve spiritual development and progress. The spiritual Seeker is looking for a method, a way that best promotes their (that is, their Ego’s) spiritual progress, through which they become a better person. The individual intends to achieve the transmutation, transformation of the Ego through the Presence. Naturally, there is a whole range of other reasons derived from the mind, but they are all characterised by the same feature: sooner or later they lead to failure. The spiritual Seeker is unable to stay in the Presence, what is more, they are unable to recognize that the Presence is something utterly different from merely concentrating on the current moment, on the current emotions, impressions and observations (that is, naturally, impossible to sustain in the long term even with a considerable effort). These reactions are, however, not utterly useless, as the failures, experience thus gathered may ultimately increase the suffering of the individual or their intuitive knowledge, and the correct motivational base of the person concerned shall be created. The Last Chapter of our Personal History The last chapter of one’s personal history begins when the spiritual Seeker becomes a spiritual seeker. As a first step of spiritual seeking the person starts to look for enlightenment, Self-recognition in the world of shapes and forms (that is, outside himself or herself) in the hope of thus reaching the state of permanent happiness. The seeker intends to find a dogma, a great Master, an elevating spiritual experience that expands his/her Consciousness. If it is not found here on Earth, the person will be looking for it in the other world, in the heaven of a religion. The Ego uses the mind as a means of spiritual search. It is through the mind that the Ego intends to understand what is beyond mind and forms. The mind in this way prepares the mental image of enlightenment, seeking, happiness etc. The mental images are born through the comprehensive process of the mind. For comprehension, the spiritual Seeker also requires information, so the spiritual Seeker shall gather bits of information like a busy ant. From books on religion and spirituality, lectures heard and conversations attended, the spiritual Seekers are attempting to screen information, ideas, opinions and experience necessary for them. The same takes place with spiritual experience. The individual assumes that if they gather a sufficient amount of experience, as a result they will reach a certain point, they will increase their spirituality. The knowledge and experience accumulated shall all form a part of the spiritual Seeker’s spiritual Ego. These mental images motivate the spiritual Seeker to make efforts at implementing the mental images at the level of daily life, to make these images the cornerstones of their life. Achieving spiritual objectives, however, affords only momentary satisfaction for the seeker, so after achieving one specific goal, relentlessness returns, urging the individual to start working for new objectives. The mind produces new mental images, and seeking starts all over again. In this way the last chapter of our personal history becomes longer and longer. At some people this chapter will be the most important part of personal history, until death closes the book. The First Step of the Journey Closing the last chapter of our personal history and taking the first step on the Journey will come with the recognition of the futility of spiritual seeking. The spiritual Seeker stops and abandons spiritual seeking. The individual recognizes that all the objectives they have so far been looking for outside themselves , are only found within themselves. The spiritual Seeker will stop when they recognize the activities of the mind and refuse to follow it any longer. The spiritual Seeker realizes that with the help of the mind they will not be able to surpass the mind. The spiritual Seeker will experience that stopping is the inactive moment of the mind, the silence between thoughts. In that silence, the spiritual Seeker will experience the Consciousness without forms, and recognize that he or she is in fact the Presence without thoughts. Starting from this internal silence, the person shall start observing the functions of their mind, and shall abandon the accumulation of spiritual teachings and the search for lofty spiritual experience. From the edge (the mind) the person will turn towards the center of his or her being (the Presence appears). That is when the spiritual Seeker learns to use their mind appropriately. The individual will recognize that spiritual teachings are only worth as much as these are relevant to the individual’s own life. That recognition will not be a fruit of the mind’s analytical work; it is only inspired by the recognitions starting from the inner silence. These recognitions are best comparable to seeing (in several spiritual teachings these people are referred to as „Seers”) and they work like relevances. The spiritual Seeker then leaves behind the spiritual seeker, with all the accumulated knowledge and lofty spiritual experience, and takes the first step on the Journey. About the Author Frank M.

The effects of trauma are experienced physically, mentally, emotionally, socially and spiritually. Many who have been touched by natural disasters or human atrocities view their spiritual distress as the most intense of these responses. While many of the therapeutic models used today all but fail to address this important aspect of humanness, a growing number of psychotherapists are exploring alternate methods of healing in an effort to address the spiritual distress experienced by their traumatized clients. As they being their study of spirituality and spiritual interventions as different from religion and religious models, some of these therapists are revisiting ancient methods of soul healing, including the time- honored teachings and practices of Shamanism. In this discussion article, the relationship between triggers, flashbacks and dissociation are explored from both a neurological perspective and a spiritual (rooted in Shamanic knowledge) perspective. These two worldviews are compared and contrasted. Questions are presented which invite psychotherapists to ponder the need for an increased understanding of spiritual distress and spiritual interventions in order to provide to their trauma clients a more balanced and holistic approach Keywords Spiritual distress; Trauma; Traumatic event Trauma and Dissociation: Neurological and Spiritual Perspectives Few would deny that the enormity of natural disasters and human atrocities of the past decades have impacted us on individual, communal, national and international levels. These frequent reminders, that trauma can happened any where and at any time, have heightened awareness of trauma and its far-reaching effects, and have escalated the search for the best treatment methods for those who are traumatized. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 1V-TR (2000) defines trauma as “an event involving actual or imagined threat of death or serious injury to self or others, or a response to intense fear, helplessness or horror, in reaction to a traumatic event” [ 1 ]. A traumatic experience triggers the fight-flight response [ 2 ]. If the emotional terror is severe, the autonomic nervous system can become overwhelmed, resulting in a freeze response [ 3 ]. In these cases the physical body looses its ability to respond; the senses dull and the mind dissociates from the body, reducing the physical and emotional distress. Dissociation at the time of the trauma is the primary predictor for the later development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [ 4 ]. The traumatic past invading into the present is a major symptom of PTSD [ 5 ]. The intrusive experiences can be triggered by a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, or even a bodily function [ 6 ]. These triggers instantly, and often subconsciously, remind the traumatized person of the trauma. If the trigger is significant enough the person may experience a flashback. A flashback is more than a memory; it is a re-experiencing of some portion of the original trauma [ 7 ]. During a flashback the person is forced to involuntarily relive that aspect of the trauma, seeing the same sights, smelling the same smells and feeling the full range of emotions that took place at the time of the original trauma [ 7 ]. Flashbacks are distressing because the traumatized person has no ability to control them, nor stop the reliving of the frightening events, thus adding to the feelings of disempowerment described by Herman [ 5 ]. Those who actively dissociate at the time of a traumatic event have a greater potential to dissociate after subsequent expose to traumatic stimuli [ 8 , 9 ]. Through dissociation, contact with reality is broken as the mind separates from the body. When this happens there is also a separation from the emotional and mental distress caused by the flashback. Dissociative reactions vary from mild to extreme. A mild dissociative reaction can include a temporary “zoning out.” If the dissociative reaction intensifies, the senses and body numb, the eyes look glazed and the person’s ability to see, hear, focus or respond dulls. If the dissociation becomes severe, the traumatized person may collapse physically. A Neurological Perspective on Trauma and Flashbacks The study and pursuit of best practices for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder, including treatment of flashbacks and dissociation, have focused on the effects of trauma on the human brain. The findings have helped to explain at least in part, the physical, mental and emotional symptoms experienced following trauma. The amygdala and hippocampus, both parts of the limbic system have major functions in the processing and sequencing of the life narrative. During the normal course of life, together the amygdala and hippocampus process both the event and the emotions attached to the event [ 2 ]. The amygdala registers emotions and bodily sensations. After the amygdala has registered the emotion and bodily sensations, they are accessed by the hippocampus. The role of the hippocampus is to add cognitive meaning and place the information into the appropriate context [ 2 ]. Once the hippocampus has registered the context, the information can be permanently stored in the cortex as explicit memory [ 7 ]. During trauma this often does not happen. The amygdala records the highly charged emotions and sensations but if the trauma is severe enough the hippocampus can become overcharged and shut down [ 7 ]. The traumatic event is then not recorded as explicit memory but is instead only recorded as implicit memory, and in the form of highly charged emotions and sensations [ 7 ]. When the images and sensations of an experience have not been integrated by the hippocampus they remain in implicit-only form [ 7 ]. Implicit-only memories are unassembled neural disarray, remaining as though frozen in time, never integrating into the life narrative [ 7 ]. When an implicit-only memory surfaces, it is experienced in full consciousness, but without the sensation that something from the past is being recalled [ 7 ]. Now that neuroscience has determined the roles played by the amygdala and hippocampus in creating memories and the differences between explicit and implicit memories it seems plausible that flashback may be the activation of an implicit-only memory [ 7 ]. If the flashback causes intense fear the person may dissociate from the experience in a way similar to that which occurred at the time of the original trauma, creating more implicit only memories. A Spiritual Perspective of Triggers, Flashbacks and Dissociation Trauma has been referred to as spiritual disconnection [ 10 - 12 ]. It is well recognized that crises, such as those experienced during and following trauma, can drive a traumatized person inward, there to experience the “dark night of the soul” [ 13 ]. Many who have been traumatized describe the soul pain they experience during their time in this spiritual cocoon as the most intense of their traumatic responses [ 14 ]. During this time, long-held beliefs can be challenged as the traumatized person faces the deeper questions of life - its meaning and purpose. Questions regarding these two spiritual needs are often voiced [ 15 ], in terms of “Why did God allow this to happen to me?” and “What am I to do with the rest of my life? Some believe the trauma has broken their spirit. Others feel that a large part of them has remained at the scene of the trauma, and because of that they no longer feel whole and complete. Some use symbolic language indicative of these or similar sensations, including: “I feel so empty.” “I feel broken.” “ I no longer feel whole.” “Something is always missing [ 16 ]” Following trauma, dreams of searching and longing can also contain messages of spiritual brokenness. One such dream, common to those who have been traumatized, is for the dreamer to be moving through a house, searching from room to room, to empty room. A Jungian interpretation of such a dream is that the house is symbolic of where soul lives while in consciousness [ 17 ]. In searching through the rooms, the soul may be looking for the soul parts that cannot be located [ 16 ]. Questions of meaning and purpose, symbolic expressions of soul brokenness, and dreams of searching, are of an existential nature, begging for a spiritual exploration. Yet numerous approaches to trauma care in use today do not address the spiritual aspects of trauma whereas in most societies, previous to the past five decades, those who attended to the ill, regardless of the causes of the illness, were spiritual specialists [ 18 ]. In these cultures, the healer most often held a Shamanic view of reality [ 19 ]. From this perspective, illness is viewed as a disharmony between the ill person’s body, mind, emotion and spirit and between the ill person and the larger environment. Healing requires a restoration of the harmonies of body, mind, emotion and spirit and includes a rebuilding of relationships with the Creator, the ancestors, other human beings and with all aspects of the environment [ 20 ]. During the last two decades, spiritual practices of healing based at least to some degree on ancient Shamanic teachings, have resurfaced in the Western world [ 21 ]. The reasons for this may be two-fold. In ever increasing numbers, clients are requesting holistic and complimentary methods of healing and more therapeutic helpers are acknowledging their responsibility to address the deep soul concerns of their clients [ 22 , 23 ]. Those therapists who do so recognize, as did their Shamanic fore bearers, the detrimental effects of trauma on the body, mind, emotion and spirit and on the interconnections of these aspects of the self. In Shamanic belief, when the mind separates from the body, as happens during dissociation, the human soul can fracture. When this happens, a part or parts of the soul can remain at the scene of the trauma, as thought frozen there in that space and time [ 20 , 24 ]. From within this perspective, a trigger is viewed as a signal to the person to pay attention to an unhealed soul wound. A flashback is acknowledged as a step on the healing journey, for it takes the traumatized person back to the traumatic scene where the fractured-off soul parts remain. Dissociation is viewed as an opportunity for the traumatized person to reclaim the soul parts and to experience a tremendous feeling of healing and wholeness. In Shamanic cultures, it is believed that during dissociation the spirit helpers place the traumatized person in an altered state. In this trance-like state, the person witnesses the soul part or parts in their frozen state. With the assistance of spiritual guides and helpers, the soul parts are removed from the trauma scene, taken to a safe place, offered a healing, and then reintegrated back into the larger and now more complete and whole soul. Shamanic healing practices are based on the premise that all illness is rooted in spiritual distress [ 21 ]. Traditional Shamanic healers, and present day therapists trained in similar spiritual practices, believe that all healing begins first at the soul level. Once the soul parts have been reclaimed and reintegrated, the traumatized person has an easier time working through the remaining mental and emotional anguish. For such practitioners, the retrieval and reintegration of the fractured-off soul parts is an important early step in the trauma treatment regime. To this end, the trauma specialist trained in the spiritual practice of soul retrieval will often initiate the work rather than allowing it to take place spontaneously during dissociation [ 10 ]. In an Initiated Soul Retrieval the traditional Shaman or therapist trained in these methods, uses a hypnotic technique to safely and gently guide the traumatized person back to the scene of the original trauma. During a Spontaneous Soul Retrieval the therapist will follow, as closely as possible, the same steps as when guiding an Initiated Soul Retrieval process. Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity, Lanius et al. [ 25 ] confirmed that persons who experience a traumatic event and are suffering from posttraumatic stress replay their traumatic memories through the sensory and imaging storage area of the brain’s right hemisphere. The therapist guiding initiated soul retrieval, or when helping the client reclaim a soul part during a dissociative experience, will recognize that during both these times the traumatized person has likely lost most connections with the brain’s left hemispheres and will therefore not be able to speak or answer questions. In these cases the therapist provides as much information prior to any possibility of conducting soul retrieval. During the process the therapist requests only a nod as a response to questions. There are four main steps to the process. The first step: safety and healing The traumatized person is told beforehand that when the trauma happened they were in a position of powerlessness. Now they must reclaim their personal power. The person is reminded that when the soul part left it did so because it experienced terror and left believing it was no longer safe within the body. The traumatized person is told to now face this situation from a position of here and now, from a place of personal empowerment, rather than from the place of disempowerment felt at the time of the trauma. The person is informed that the fractured soul parts will be mirror representations of them, as they were at the time of the original incident. The therapist reminds the traumatized person that during the experience, when a first contact is made with a part of them at the scene of the original trauma, they are to do whatever is necessary to make that soul part feel safe. The traumatized person is encouraged to invite their spirit guides and helpers to be present and to request their assistance when they are trying to make the traumatized soul part feel safe. The traumatized person is also encouraged to request the spirit guides and helpers to do a healing for the soul part so that when it returns and is integrated it is no longer traumatized, but as healed as possible. A therapist who approaches trauma processing from a spiritual perspective recognizes the power in working with the archetypes. Jung [ 26 ] taught the need to draw on the wisdom and strength of the archetypal characters when guiding people out of dark and fearful places. When working with an archetype, the soul or psyche draws on images from the individual’s history and culture. In some cultures the spirit guides will be in the form of ancestors. Greek Gods and Goddesses may be powerful archetypal guides for those of Greek heritage. In other cultures, spirit guides may appear as animal helpers. Archetypal helpers such as Bear, Eagle and Raven are common with some indigenous peoples of North America, whereas the Reindeer is a more common spirit guide for those living in Siberian regions. For those with a strong religious background, the spirit guides and helpers can represent figures more closely associated with those of their organized religion and can include angels, Jesus or the Buddha. The second step: updating and encouraging return When the traumatized person indicates with a nod that the soul part is safe and that the spirit guides have completed the healing, the therapist encourages the traumatized person to update the located soul part. The traumatized person is reminded that this soul part went away long ago and has no idea of what has happened since that time. The person is encouraged to tell the soul part all the good things that have taken place since the time of the trauma. The person is also encouraged to let the soul part know that everything possible will be done to keep it safe from now on. The traumatized person is then encouraged to make a clear statement about how much the soul part is wanted back so that life can be even better, more whole and complete. The third step: soul and body integration and welcoming When the soul part is ready to return, the therapist guides the traumatized person through a process of bringing the soul part up various layers of consciousness. The person is then helped to breathe the soul part in and seal it into the crown of the head and the heart energy centers. The therapist helps the person welcome the soul part home. This is often accompanied by a song or with humming. The person is then encouraged to move in a rocking motion as a way to initiate bodily integration. The rocking motion is also often accompanied by a song or soft humming as a further way to enhance the welcoming home process. The desire to integrate the soul part into the body is based on the belief that soul inhabits every part of the body. The fourth step: Processing and mental integration When the traumatized person has completed the reintegration of the soul part they are called back from the trance state and reconnected with the present reality. The therapist then engages the person in a conversation about the experience and how the experience and its effects were perceived. This important step is done based on the belief that not only does soul inhabit every part of the body; soul inhabits every aspect of human existence, past and present. The goal of the verbal processing is to integrate the past into the present. Having healed the soul the person is now more ready to address the emotional, mental and social effects of their traumatic past. Blending the Perspectives In Western methods of treatment, if and when dissociation happens, there is a great amount of energy spent on immediately bringing the person back in touch with reality. No attempts are made to do any healing during such times. From a traditional Shamanic and soul healing perspective each time dissociation happens and the person is not given the opportunity to heal and reintegrate the fractured-off soul parts, other soul parts may also fracture off and remain trapped in the terror of that time and space. Is it possible that during the soul retrieval experience the person flashes back to the intrinsic-only memory of the amygdala? When the soul part is made safe, healed and freed, is the fear and terror stored in that intrinsic-only memory also released? Rothschild [ 27 ] noted that once implicit-only memories are released and made explicit, left brain friendly strategies can be more effectively employed to process and integrate those memories as part of the life narrative. Does the release of the emotions of fear and terror, along with the verbal processing after the experience, enable the hippocampus to make cognitive sense of the experience? Does the process of making cognitive sense of the experience allow the implicit-only memory to then be stored as an explicit memory and become a part of the life narrative? The amygdala appears to be the limbic structure through which sensory information travels on its way to the right hemisphere. The hippocampus is much more closely associated with functions of the left cerebral hemisphere [ 6 ]. Each of the brain’s hemispheres has its own way of knowing, its own way of perceiving reality. The left hemisphere is associated with cognitive and analytical functioning, reason and logic, and the development and use of language skills [ 7 ]. The right hemisphere is more closely associated with things more linked to the heart and of a spiritual nature than to the cognitive mind. As noted earlier, Lanius et al. [ 25 ] confirmed that persons who experience a traumatic event and are suffering from posttraumatic stress replay their traumatic memories through the sensory and imaging storage area of the brain’s right hemisphere. For generations, following a traumatic life event, healers used experiences that engaged more fully the brain’s right hemisphere than the left, including drumming, dance, and the use of symbols that appeared in the person’s dreams, art, and imagery. They used ceremony and sacred rituals to heal the soul pain and call back the spirit energy that had left at the time of trauma [ 28 ]. In using soulful strategies, they were addressing the needs of the brain’s right hemisphere. In speaking the language of the soul, were they unknowingly (or perhaps knowingly) going to the very seat of the trauma, into the intrinsic only memories and healing the stored trauma. From a neurological perspective, dissociation is seen as the body and mind’s attempt to escape the pain caused by the situation. Therapists trained in soul healing methods and many trauma clients view dissociation from the original trauma as a spiritual experience. Those who have experienced trauma often speak of how during the trauma they were lifted away by angels. Some speak of being in a cloud, watching the abuse or trauma taking place, all the while being absent from the physical and emotional pain. Others recall being removed from the scene by a spirit guide or being surrounded by ancestors. The dissociation that happens when a traumatized person is triggered back to the traumatic event is generally viewed in psychological terms as pathological. From a spiritual perspective the dissociation that results from a sensory or somatic trigger is seen as a call from soul to reclaim the soul parts that have remained frozen in the time and space of the original trauma. These parallel but separate views of dissociation emerge from two distinct paradigms for managing the symptoms and for healing the dissociative responses. The psychotherapist trained solely in Western methods of helping focuses on the application of strategies to mainly gain the attention of the brain’s left hemisphere and thereby attempts to heal the cognitive mind. The traditional Shaman, and the therapist trained in spiritual healing practices believe the soul, like the body, has self-healing capabilities and offers strategies to assist the soul in reclaiming its wholeness. To combine the methodologies from these two distinct world views is to offer the trauma client an approach aimed at healing body, mind and spirit. Conclusion Trauma caused by natural disasters and human atrocities surrounds us. Many who have been touched by such events view their soul pain as the most intense of their responses. To respond to spiritual distress, and offer strategies for soul healing, practitioners require advanced knowledge of the effects of trauma on the human spirit, and on how to incorporate spiritual approaches into their client care. In our multicultural and mobile world, many who are attempting to reorder their lives following a traumatic life event may come from countries and cultures that resonate more completely and comfortably with spiritual approaches to healing than they do with cognitive-based approaches. Is there room within psychotherapeutic practice for an intentional blending of the methods for soul healing as described since ancient times, along with the scientific methodologies in use today?
