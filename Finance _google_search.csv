Review Methodological Work Single Projects Third IPCC Assessment Report Transfer of Technologies Your location: Home > Climate Finance FOCUS: Climate Finance Climate finance Climate finance refers to local, national or transnational financing, which may be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. Climate finance is critical to addressing climate change because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions, notably in sectors that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. Climate finance is equally important for adaptation, for which significant financial resources will be similarly required to allow countries to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of climate change.

Climate Finance main page Standing Committee on Finance Long-Term Finance Climate Finance Portal Review of the Financial Mechanism Adaptation Fund Global Environment Facility Green Climate Fund Least Developed Countries Fund Special Climate Change Fund Fast-start Finance Social Media Outreach Inspiring Examples of Action UNFCCC facebook UNFCCC twitter Climate finance, continued In accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities set out in the Convention, developed country Parties (Annex II Parties) are to provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties in implementing the objectives of the UNFCCC. It is important for all governments and stakeholders to understand and assess the financial needs developing countries have so that such countries can undertake activities to address climate change. Governments and all other stakeholders also need to understand the sources of this financing, in other words, how these financial resources will be mobilized. Equally significant is the way in which these resources are transferred to and accessed by developing countries. Developing countries need to know that financial resources are predictable, sustainable, and that the channels used allow them to utilize the resources directly without difficulty. For developed countries, it is important that developing countries are able to demonstrate their ability to effectively receive and utilize the resources. In addition, there needs to be full transparency in the way the resources are used for mitigation and adaptation activities. The effective measurement, reporting and verification of climate finance is key to building trust between Parties to the Convention, and also for external actors. Main-topics Standing Committee on Finance The Standing Committee on Finance was created by Parties to the Convention with the aim of assisting the COP, with regards to, for example, transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness in the delivery of climate finance. Furthermore, the Standing Committee on Finance is designed to improve the linkages and to promote the coordination with climate finance related actors and initiatives within and outside the Convention. The committee consists of twenty members, with ten members from developing countries and ten members from developed countries, who work together to assist the Conference of the Parties (COP) with regards to the Financial Mechanism of the Convention. Currently, the Standing Committee on Finance has been assigned four specific functions by Parties to allow it to meet its goal. Firstly, the committee has the function of assisting the COP to improve coherence and coordination in the delivery of climate change financing. Secondly, the committee has the function of working to assist the COP in a rationalization of the Financial Mechanism of the UNFCCC. The third function of the Standing Committee on Finance is to support the COP in the mobilization of financial resources for climate financing. Finally, the fourth function is to support the COP in the measurement, reporting and verification of support provided to developing country Parties. The Standing Committee on Finance meets at least twice a year, and has been assigned a series of activities by the Parties in relation to its four functions. Long-term Finance The financial resources required to assist developing countries in undertaking mitigation and adaptation activities will become more and more significant in the future as such countries take on more responsibilities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and as the impacts of climate change become more prevalent. Long-term finance refers to climate finance that is required to allow developing countries to undertake mitigation and adaptation activities in the long term. It includes an understanding that the sources of this finance will be public, private and alternative sources, and that a significant scaling up of resources will be required to allow for developing countries to be able to effectively undertake these activities to meet the objectives of the Convention. The funding that will be provided to developing countries will have to take into account their urgent and immediate needs, especially of those countries which are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Additionally, in order to allow developing countries to respond to climate change, this funding also needs to be predictable and adequate. Finance Portal The Finance Portal comprises three modules, each of which includes information made available by Parties to the Convention and the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention. The first module is the ‘National Communications Module’ and presents information communicated by contributing countries on the provision of financial resources, in the context of regular reporting to the Convention. The second module, the ‘Fast-start Finance Module’, includes information on resources provided by developed countries in the context of their commitment to provide approximately USD 30 billion over the period 2010 – 2012. The third module, the ‘Funds Managed by the GEF’ is a joint effort between the secretariat of the UNFCCC and the secretariat of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and contains information on climate finance flows of the GEF in its role as one of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention. Additionally to the three modules, information on projects and programmes of the Adaptation Fund can be found in the Finance Portal. This fund was established under the Kyoto Protocol of the Convention to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

You will need to make time to spend 2 weeks full-time on campus when the modules are in session (12 weeks in total), and spend significant time on independent study in between, so it is important that you have your employer’s support to attend the programme. Can the programme be done online? Our classes are highly interactive and the power of personal relationships is part and parcel of the programme. Our faculty are experts at tapping into the experience and knowledge of the participants in the room to encourage the exchange of best practices and collective learning. Therefore, the programme cannot be done online. What is the duration of the programme? The programme duration is 18 months and it comprises 6 on-campus modules of 12 weeks in total. Do I need to study when not on campus? Yes, there is significant work to be completed between modules and this independent study time equates to approximately 17 weeks. Between modules 5 and 6, you will also need to work on a major degree project. View all EMFIN Events Download brochure Apply online Contact us Back to Top Login . Sign up with Email .

It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return . Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance , corporate finance and personal finance . Contents 1 Areas of finance 1.1 Personal finance 1.2 Corporate finance 1.2.1 Financial services 1.3 Public finance 2 Capital 3 Financial theory 3.1 Financial economics 3.2 Financial mathematics 3.3 Experimental finance 3.4 Behavioral finance 3.5 Intangible asset finance 4 Professional qualifications 5 Unsolved problems in finance 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Areas of finance [ edit ] Wall Street , the center of American finance. London Stock Exchange , global center of finance. Personal finance [ edit ] Main article: Personal finance Questions in personal finance revolve around: Protection against unforeseen personal events, as well as events in the wider economies Transference of family wealth across generations (bequests and inheritance) Effects of tax policies (tax subsidies and/or penalties) on management of personal finances Effects of credit on individual financial standing Development of a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home) Planning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability Personal finance may involve paying for education, financing durable goods such as real estate and cars, buying insurance , e.g. health and property insurance, investing and saving for retirement . Personal finance may also involve paying for a loan, or debt obligations. The six key areas of personal financial planning, as suggested by the Financial Planning Standards Board, are: [1] Financial position : is concerned with understanding the personal resources available by examining net worth and household cash flow. Net worth is a person's balance sheet, calculated by adding up all assets under that person's control, minus all liabilities of the household, at one point in time. Household cash flow totals up all the expected sources of income within a year, minus all expected expenses within the same year. From this analysis, the financial planner can determine to what degree and in what time the personal goals can be accomplished. Adequate protection : the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks. These risks can be divided into the following: liability, property, death, disability, health and long term care. Some of these risks may be self-insurable, while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract. Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance. Business owners, professionals, athletes and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves. Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products may be a critical piece of the overall investment planning. Tax planning : typically the income tax is the single largest expense in a household. Managing taxes is not a question of if you will pay taxes, but when and how much. Government gives many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits, which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden. Most modern governments use a progressive tax. Typically, as one's income grows, a higher marginal rate of tax must be paid. Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one's personal finances can make a significant impact in which it can later save you money in the long term. Investment and accumulation goals : planning how to accumulate enough money - for large purchases and life events - is what most people consider to be financial planning. Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and when you need to withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals. A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation . Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments. In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock and/or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments. The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person. Retirement planning is the process of understanding how much it costs to live at retirement, and coming up with a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall. Methods for retirement plan include taking advantage of government allowed structures to manage tax liability including: individual ( IRA ) structures, or employer sponsored retirement plans . Estate planning involves planning for the disposition of one's assets after death. Typically, there is a tax due to the state or federal government at one's death. Avoiding these taxes means that more of one's assets will be distributed to one's heirs. One can leave one's assets to family, friends or charitable groups. Corporate finance [ edit ] Main article: Corporate finance Corporate finance deals with the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations, the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms. Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock , and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation. In the first, ""capital budgeting"", management must choose which ""projects"" (if any) to undertake. The discipline of capital budgeting may employ standard business valuation techniques or even extend to real options valuation ; see Financial modeling . The second, ""sources of capital"" relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of equity (privately or via an initial public offering ), creditors , often in the form of bonds , and the firm's operations ( cash flow ). Short-term funding or working capital is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's capital structure . The third, ""the dividend policy"", requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form. Short term financial management is often termed "" working capital management "", and relates to cash- , inventory - and debtors management. Corporate finance also includes within its scope business valuation, stock investing, or investment management . An investment is an acquisition of an asset in the hope that it will maintain or increase its value over time that will in hope give back a higher rate of return when it comes to disbursing dividends. In investment management – in choosing a portfolio – one has to use financial analysis to determine what , how much and when to invest. To do this, a company must: Identify relevant objectives and constraints: institution or individual goals, time horizon, risk aversion and tax considerations; Identify the appropriate strategy: active versus passive hedging strategy Measure the portfolio performance Financial management overlaps with the financial function of the accounting profession . However, financial accounting is the reporting of historical financial information , while financial management is concerned with the allocation of capital resources to increase a firm's value to the shareholders and increase their rate of return on the investments. Financial risk management , an element of corporate finance, is the practice of creating and protecting economic value in a firm by using financial instruments to manage exposure to risk , particularly credit risk and market risk . (Other risk types include foreign exchange , shape, volatility , sector, liquidity , inflation risks, etc.) It focuses on when and how to hedge using financial instruments; in this sense it overlaps with financial engineering . Similar to general risk management , financial risk management requires identifying its sources, measuring it (see: Risk measure: Well known risk measures ), and formulating plans to address these, and can be qualitative and quantitative. In the banking sector worldwide, the Basel Accords are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks. [ citation needed ] Financial services [ edit ] Main article: Financial services An entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess income to help that excess income produce more income in the future. Though on the other hand, an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims, decreasing its expenses, or increasing its income. The lender can find a borrower—a financial intermediary such as a bank —or buy notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the bond market . The lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan. A bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity. Finance is used by individuals ( personal finance ), by governments ( public finance ), by businesses ( corporate finance ) and by a wide variety of other organizations such as schools and non-profit organizations. In general, the goals of each of the above activities are achieved through the use of appropriate financial instruments and methodologies, with consideration to their institutional setting. Finance is one of the most important aspects of business management and includes analysis related to the use and acquisition of funds for the enterprise. In corporate finance, a company's capital structure is the total mix of financing methods it uses to raise funds. One method is debt financing , which includes bank loans and bond sales. Another method is equity financing - the sale of stock by a company to investors, the original shareholders (they own a portion of the business) of a share. Ownership of a share gives the shareholder certain contractual rights and powers, which typically include the right to receive declared dividends and to vote the proxy on important matters (e.g., board elections). The owners of both bonds (either government bonds or corporate bonds) and stock (whether its preferred stock or common stock), may be institutional investors - financial institutions such as investment banks and pension funds or private individuals, called private investors or retail investors . Public finance [ edit ] Main article: Public finance Public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states and sub-national entities (states/provinces, counties, municipalities, etc.) and related public entities (e.g. school districts) or agencies. It usually encompasses a long-term, strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities. [2] These long-term, strategic periods usually encompass five or more years. [3] Public finance is primarily concerned with: Identification of required expenditure of a public sector entity Source(s) of that entity's revenue The budgeting process Debt issuance ( municipal bonds ) for public works projects Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve System banks in the United States and Bank of England in the United Kingdom , are strong players in public finance, acting as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy. [4] Capital [ edit ] Main article: Financial capital Capital , in the financial sense, is the money that gives the business the power to buy goods to be used in the production of other goods or the offering of a service. (The capital has two types of resources, Equity and Debt). The deployment of capital is decided by the budget. This may include the objective of business, targets set, and results in financial terms, e.g., the target set for sale, resulting cost, growth, required investment to achieve the planned sales, and financing source for the investment. A budget may be long term or short term. Long term budgets have a time horizon of 5–10 years giving a vision to the company; short term is an annual budget which is drawn to control and operate in that particular year. Budgets will include proposed fixed asset requirements and how these expenditures will be financed. Capital budgets are often adjusted annually (done every year) and should be part of a longer-term Capital Improvements Plan. A cash budget is also required. The working capital requirements of a business are monitored at all times to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to meet short-term expenses. The cash budget is basically a detailed plan that shows all expected sources and uses of cash when it comes to spending it appropriately. The cash budget has the following six main sections: Beginning Cash Balance - contains the last period's closing cash balance, in other words, the remaining cash from last years earnings. Cash collections - includes all expected cash receipts (all sources of cash for the period considered, mainly sales) Cash disbursements - lists all planned cash outflows for the period such as dividend, excluding interest payments on short-term loans, which appear in the financing section. All expenses that do not affect cash flow are excluded from this list (e.g. depreciation, amortization, etc.) Cash excess or deficiency - a function of the cash needs and cash available. Cash needs are determined by the total cash disbursements plus the minimum cash balance required by company policy. If total cash available is less than cash needs, a deficiency exists. Financing - discloses the planned borrowings and repayments of those planned borrowings, including interest. Financial theory [ edit ] Financial economics [ edit ] Main article: Financial economics Financial economics is the branch of economics studying the interrelation of financial variables , such as prices , interest rates and shares, as opposed to goods and services . Financial economics concentrates on influences of real economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance. It centres on managing risk in the context of the financial markets , and the resultant economic and financial models . It essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of an investment policy. Here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the CAPM ), and to the Black–Scholes theory for option valuation ; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended. ""Financial economics"", at least formally, also considers investment under "" certainty "" ( Fisher separation theorem , ""theory of investment value"" , Modigliani–Miller theorem ) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory. Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested. Although closely related, the disciplines of economics and finance are distinctive. The “economy” is a social institution that organizes a society’s production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, all of which must be financed. Economists make a number of abstract assumptions for purposes of their analyses and predictions. They generally regard financial markets that function for the financial system as an efficient mechanism ( Efficient-market hypothesis ). Instead, financial markets are subject to human error and emotion. [5] New research discloses the mischaracterization of investment safety and measures of financial products and markets so complex that their effects, especially under conditions of uncertainty, are impossible to predict. The study of finance is subsumed under economics as financial economics, but the scope, speed, power relations and practices of the financial system can uplift or cripple whole economies and the well-being of households, businesses and governing bodies within them—sometimes in a single day. Financial mathematics [ edit ] Main article: Financial mathematics Financial mathematics is a field of applied mathematics , concerned with financial markets . The subject has a close relationship with the discipline of financial economics, which is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics. Generally, mathematical finance will derive, and extend, the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics. In terms of practice, mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the field of computational finance (also known as financial engineering ). Arguably, these are largely synonymous, although the latter focuses on application, while the former focuses on modelling and derivation ( see: Quantitative analyst ). The field is largely focused on the modelling of derivatives , although other important subfields include insurance mathematics and quantitative portfolio problems . See Outline of finance: Mathematical tools ; Outline of finance: Derivatives pricing . Experimental finance [ edit ] Main article: Experimental finance Experimental finance aims to establish different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, and the way that these people act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings. Behavioral finance [ edit ] Main article: Behavioral economics Behavioral finance studies how the psychology of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas. Behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become central and very important to finance. [ citation needed ] Behavioral finance includes such topics as: Empirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories. Models of how psychology affects and impacts trading and prices Forecasting based on these methods. Studies of experimental asset markets and use of models to forecast experiments. A strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed Quantitative Behavioral Finance , which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. Some of this endeavor has been led by Gunduz Caginalp (Professor of Mathematics and Editor of Journal of Behavioral Finance during 2001-2004) and collaborators including Vernon Smith (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics), David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran). Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant behavioral effects in stocks and exchange traded funds. Among other topics, quantitative behavioral finance studies behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets. Intangible asset finance [ edit ] Main article: Intangible asset finance Intangible asset finance is the area of finance that deals with intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, goodwill, reputation, etc. Intangible assets are divided into indefinite or definite. The brand name of a company is an indefinite asset; it stays with the company throughout its existence. A patent however, granted to that company for a limited amount of time would be a definite intangible asset. [6] Professional qualifications [ edit ] There are several related professional qualifications , that can lead to the field: Generalist Finance qualifications: Degrees: Master of Science in Finance (MSF), Master of Finance (M.Fin), Master of Financial Economics , Master of Applied Finance , Master of Liberal Arts in Finance (ALM.Fin) Certifications: Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Certified Treasury Professional (CTP), Certified Valuation Analyst (CVA), Certified Patent Valuation Analyst (CPVA), Chartered Business Valuator (CBV), Certified International Investment Analyst (CIIA), Financial Risk Manager (FRM), Professional Risk Manager (PRM), Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), Certified Market Analyst (CMA/FAD) Dual Designation, Corporate Finance Qualification (CF), Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA), Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) Quantitative Finance qualifications: Master of Financial Engineering (MSFE), Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF), Master of Computational Finance (MCF), Master of Financial Mathematics (MFM), Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF).

Since then, it has empowered thousands of children across the nation. Read about our other initiatives. Join Us Locate Us Call Us 022 - 6652 6000 “ I used to be a taxi driver in Mumbai for six years. But a dire need of money forced me to leave my motherland and migrate to Saudi Arabia to earn a living. I worked there as a private car driver and did well monetarily. But for me, money couldn't replace the joy of working in my own motherland. Five years later, I decided to return home. With my savings of Rs. 1 lakh, I started a business dealing in scraps in Hyderabad. But then things didn't go too well and I lost all my money in the business. My confidence took a big hit and I was back to where I was – being an ordinary taxi driver. But somewhere in my heart I always believed that those who try, can never fail. From whatever I earned as a taxi driver, I managed to save Rs. 30,000. Using that, I took up a three wheeler loan from Mahindra Finance to buy an Alfa Load. And thanks to them, I am a proud owner of a vehicle. Since then, my earnings have considerably increased and so has my respect in the society. Today, I feel much more confident about myself and I am now looking forward to buying a second vehicle as soon as the loan for the first one is over. I am grateful to Mahindra Finance for helping me 'Rise' in my own country. ” See our products © 2014 Mahindra Finance CIN - L65921MH1991PLC059642 Sitemap RSS Feed Terms of Use Disclaimer Privacy Policy Recently viewed Favourite Pages Recently viewed Favourite Pages 3 0 YouTube Blog Google+ About us The Organisation History and Milestones Management Mahindra Group Customer Testimonials Subsidiaries Corporate Social Responsibility Vehicle Loans Tractor Loans Utility Vehicle Loans Car Loans Three Wheeler Loans Commercial Vehicle Loans Two Wheeler Loans Used Vehicle Loans SME Loans SME Loans Project Finance Equipment Finance Corporate Loans Secured Business Loans Working Capital Loans Financial Advisory Insurance Solutions Loans Home Loans Personal Loans Gold Loans Investment Fixed Deposits Mutual Funds Insurance Calculators Tractor Loans Calculator Car Loans Calculator Fixed Deposits Calculator Utility Vehicle Loans Calculator Commercial Vehicle Loans Calculator Health Insurance Calculator Used Vehicle Loans Calculator Online EMI Payments Pay EMI Please rotate your IPAD to Landscape Mode.
