I am not a song-a-day person. This one took almost a year for no reason really. I had written this gospel-like chord progression but everything I tried to do with it sounded predictable so I threw it out. Patrick found it months later buried in a folder of forgotten demos and immediately wrote this frantic, way over the top drum beat. That solved the song for both of us. Lyrics were the final obstacle. I didnt finish them unt ... il four months later while we were sailing. Patrick was coping with the serious illness of a loved-one, and I found myself trying to comfort him. The impulse worked its way into the song, Ill write your cares away that I might spare you painIll hide you from the world until were forgotten. Faced with losing a loved one, while we ourselves were at risk on the ocean, made us strangely somber yet optimistic. We felt the precariousness of our lives and said to it: in the morning Ill be better. ???? ???

I can't expect the world to be transformed through an election. I've got to get in there and do some real work. War Child in particular is doing incredible work with women and children in conflict areas and I'm very committed to finding ways to assist them in their efforts. It's # givingtuesday --whatever that is, I've never heard of it before--but find your thing and do what you can. If you are as heartbroken by the Syrian refugee crisis as I am, take a look at War Child. Link in bio ? Tennis Music 17 ????????? ???? 12:47 PM ????? · We've got pins people!

36,"Table tennis - Wikipedia Table tennis From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search ""Ping-pong"" redirects here. For other uses, see Ping-pong (disambiguation) . Table tennis Table tennis at the highest level Highest governing body ITTF Characteristics Contact No Team members Single or doubles Type Racquet sport , indoor Equipment Poly, 40 mm (1.57 in), 2.7 g (0.095 oz) Presence Olympic since 1988 Paralympic since inaugural 1960 Summer Paralympics Table tennis , also known as ping pong , is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using a small bat. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 220 member associations. [1] The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook. [2] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988 , [3] with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008 , a team event has been played instead of the doubles.

[4] [5] It has been suggested that makeshift versions of the game were developed by British military officers in India in around 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. [6] A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball. [7] [8] It had several different names, including 'whiff-whaff'. The name ""ping-pong"" was in wide use before British manufacturer J. Jaques & Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name ""ping-pong"" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive Jaques's equipment, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the ""ping-pong"" name to Parker Brothers . Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920s making the various associations change their names to ""table tennis"" instead of the more common, but trademarked, term. [9] The next major innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British enthusiast of table tennis, who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of pimpled, or stippled, rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis was growing in popularity by 1901 to the extent that tournaments were being organized, books being written on the subject, [7] and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902. In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded in Britain, and the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. [4] [10] London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association , now called USA Table Tennis, was formed. [4] [11] In the 1930s, Edgar Snow commented in Red Star Over China that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War had a ""passion for the English game of table tennis"" which he found ""bizarre"". [12] On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects. [13] In the 1950s, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically, [4] introducing greater spin and speed. [14] These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to ""slow the game down"". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988 . [15] Rule changes After the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the ITTF instituted several rule changes that were aimed at making table tennis more viable as a televised spectator sport. [16] [17] First, the older 38 mm (1.50 in) balls were officially replaced by 40 mm (1.57 in) balls in October 2000. [7] [18] This increased the ball's air resistance and effectively slowed down the game. By that time, players had begun increasing the thickness of the fast sponge layer on their paddles, which made the game excessively fast and difficult to watch on television. A few months later, the ITTF changed from a 21-point to an 11-point scoring system (and the serve rotation was reduced from five points to two), effective in September 2001. [7] This was intended to make games more fast-paced and exciting. The ITTF also changed the rules on service to prevent a player from hiding the ball during service, in order to increase the average length of rallies and to reduce the server's advantage, effective in 2002. [19] For the opponent to have time to realize a serve is taking place, the ball must be tossed a minimum of 16 cm in the air. The ITTF states that all events after July 2014 are played with a new poly material ball. [20] [21] Equipment Ball Assortment of 40 mm table tennis balls The international rules specify that the game is played with a sphere having a mass of 2.7 grams (0.095 oz) and a diameter of 40 millimetres (1.57 in). [22] The rules say that the ball shall bounce up 2426 cm (9.410.2 in) when dropped from a height of 30.5 cm (12.0 in) onto a standard steel block thereby having a coefficient of restitution of 0.89 to 0.92. The ball is made of celluloid plastic as of 2015, colored white or orange, with a matte finish. The choice of ball color is made according to the table color and its surroundings. For example, a white ball is easier to see on a green or blue table than it is on a grey table. Manufacturers often indicate the quality of the ball with a star rating system, usually from one to three, three being the highest grade. As this system is not standard across manufacturers, the only way a ball may be used in official competition is upon ITTF approval [22] (the ITTF approval can be seen printed on the ball). The 40 mm ball was introduced after the 2000 Summer Olympics . [18] However, this created some controversy at the time as the Chinese National Team argued that this was merely to give non-Chinese players a better chance of winning since the new type of ball has a slower speed (a 40 mm table tennis ball is slower and spins less than the original 38 mm one, and at that time, most Chinese players were playing with fast attack and smashes). China won all four Olympic gold medals and three silvers in 2000 , and have continued to dominate. [ citation needed ] Table Diagram of a table tennis table showing the official dimensions The table is 2.74 m (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 m (5.0 ft) wide, and 76 cm (2.5 ft) high with any continuous material so long as the table yields a uniform bounce of about 23 cm (9.1 in) when a standard ball is dropped onto it from a height of 30 cm (11.8 in), or about 7001770000000000000? 77%. [23] [24] The table or playing surface is uniformly dark coloured and matte, divided into two halves by a net at 15.25 cm (6.0 in) in height. The ITTF approves only wooden tables or their derivates. Concrete tables with a steel net or a solid concrete partition are sometimes available in outside public spaces, such as parks. [25] Paddle/racket Main article: Table tennis racket Players are equipped with a laminated wooden racket covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the grip of the player. The ITTF uses the term ""racket"", [26] though ""bat"" is common in Britain, and ""paddle"" in the U.S. and Canada. The wooden portion of the racket, often referred to as the ""blade"", commonly features anywhere between one and seven plies of wood, though cork, glass fiber, carbon fiber, aluminum fiber, and Kevlar are sometimes used. According to the ITTF regulations, at least 85% of the blade by thickness shall be of natural wood. [27] Common wood types include balsa , limba , and cypress or "" hinoki "", which is popular in Japan. The average size of the blade is about 17 centimetres (6.7 in) long and 15 centimetres (5.9 in) wide. Although the official restrictions only focus on the flatness and rigidness of the blade itself, these dimensions are optimal for most play styles. Table tennis regulations allow different surfaces on each side of the racket. [28] Various types of surfaces provide various levels of spin or speed, and in some cases they nullify spin. For example, a player may have a rubber that provides much spin on one side of their racket, and one that provides no spin on the other. By flipping the racket in play, different types of returns are possible. To help a player distinguish between the rubber used by his opposing player, international rules specify that one side must be red while the other side must be black. [27] The player has the right to inspect his opponent's racket before a match to see the type of rubber used and what colour it is. Despite high speed play and rapid exchanges, a player can see clearly what side of the racket was used to hit the ball. Current rules state that, unless damaged in play, the racket cannot be exchanged for another racket at any time during a match. [29] Gameplay Starting a game According to ITTF rule 2.13.1, the first service is decided by lot, [30] normally a coin toss . [31] It is also common for one player (or the umpire/scorer) to hide the ball in one or the other hand, usually hidden under the table, allowing the other player to guess which hand the ball is in. The correct or incorrect guess gives the ""winner"" the option to choose to serve, receive, or to choose which side of the table to use. (A common but non-sanctioned method is for the players to play the ball back and forth three times and then play out the point. This is commonly referred to as ""serve to play"", ""rally to serve"", ""play for serve"", or ""volley for serve"".) Service and return In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play. [32] The server first stands with the ball held on the open palm of the hand not carrying the paddle, called the freehand, and tosses the ball directly upward without spin, at least 16 cm (6.3 in) high. [33] The server strikes the ball with the racket on the ball's descent so that it touches first his court and then touches directly the receiver's court without touching the net assembly. In casual games, many players do not toss the ball upward; however, this is technically illegal and can give the serving player an unfair advantage. The ball must remain behind the endline and above the upper surface of the table, known as the playing surface, at all times during the service. The server cannot use his/her body or clothing to obstruct sight of the ball; the opponent and the umpire must have a clear view of the ball at all times. If the umpire is doubtful of the legality of a service they may first interrupt play and give a warning to the server. If the serve is a clear failure or is doubted again by the umpire after the warning, the receiver scores a point. If the service is ""good"", then the receiver must make a ""good"" return by hitting the ball back before it bounces a second time on receiver's side of the table so that the ball passes the net and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly. [34] Thereafter, the server and receiver must alternately make a return until the rally is over. Returning the serve is one of the most difficult parts of the game, as the server's first move is often the least predictable and thus most advantageous shot due to the numerous spin and speed choices at his or her disposal. Let A Let is a rally of which the result is not scored, and is called in the following circumstances: [35] The ball touches the net in service (service), provided the service is otherwise correct or the ball is obstructed by the player on the receiving side. Obstruction means a player touches the ball when it is above or traveling towards the playing surface, not having touched the player's court since last being struck by the player. When the player on the receiving side is not ready and the service is delivered. Player's failure to make a service or a return or to comply with the Laws is due to a disturbance outside the control of the player. Play is interrupted by the umpire or assistant umpire. A let is also called foul service, if the ball hits the server's side of the table, if the ball does not pass further than the edge and if the ball hits the table edge and hits the net. Scoring A point is scored by the player for any of several results of the rally: [36] The opponent fails to make a correct service or return. After making a service or a return, the ball touches anything other than the net assembly before being struck by the opponent. The ball passes over the player's court or beyond his end line without touching his court, after being struck by the opponent. The opponent obstructs the ball. The opponent strikes the ball twice successively. Note that the hand that is holding the racket counts as part of the racket and that making a good return off one's hand or fingers is allowed. It is not a fault if the ball accidentally hits one's hand or fingers and then subsequently hits the racket. The opponent strikes the ball with a side of the racket blade whose surface is not covered with rubber. The opponent moves the playing surface or touches the net assembly. The opponent's free hand touches the playing surface. As a receiver under the expedite system, completing 13 returns in a rally. [37] The opponent that has been warned by the umpire commits a second offense in the same individual match or team match. If the third offence happens, 2 points will be given to the player. [38] If the individual match or the team match has not ended, any unused penalty points can be transferred to the next game of that match. [31] A game shall be won by the player first scoring 11 points unless both players score 10 points, when the game shall be won by the first player subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. A match shall consist of the best of any odd number of games. [39] In competition play, matches are typically best of five or seven games. Alternation of services and ends Service alternates between opponents every two points (regardless of winner of the rally) until the end of the game, unless both players score ten points or the expedite system is operated, when the sequences of serving and receiving stay the same but each player serves for only one point in turn (Deuce). [40] The player serving first in a game receives first in the next game of the match. After each game, players switch sides of the table. In the last possible game of a match, for example the seventh game in a best of seven matches, players change ends when the first player scores five points, regardless of whose turn it is to serve. Service is subject to change on game point of the match. Upon the possible last point of the match, the player with the lesser score serves. If the sequence of serving and receiving is out of turn or the ends are not changed, points scored in the wrong situation are still calculated and the game shall be resumed with the order at the score that has been reached. Doubles game Service zone in doubles game In addition to games between individual players, pairs may also play table tennis. Singles and doubles are both played in international competition, including the Olympic Games since 1988 and the Commonwealth Games since 2002. [41] In 2005, the ITTF announced that doubles table tennis only was featured as a part of team events in the 2008 Olympics. In doubles, all the rules of single play are applied except for the following. Service A line painted along the long axis of the table to create doubles courts bisects the table. This line's only purpose is to facilitate the doubles service rule, which is that service must originate from the right hand ""box"" in such a way that the first bounce of the serve bounces once in said right hand box and then must bounce at least once in the opponent side's right hand box (far left box for server), or the receiving pair score a point. [33] Order of play, serving and receiving Players must hit the ball in turn. For example, if A is paired with B, X is paired with Y, A is the server and X is the receiver. The order of play shall be A?X?B?Y. The rally proceeds this way until one side fails to make a legal return and the other side scores. [42] At each change of service, the previous receiver shall become the server and the partner of the previous server shall become the receiver. For example, if the previous order of play is A?X?B?Y, the order becomes X?B?Y?A after the change of service. [40] In the second or the latter games of a match, the game begins in reverse order of play. For example, if the order of play is A?X?B?Y at beginning of the first game, the order begins with X?A?Y?B or Y?B?X?A in the second game depending on either X or Y being chosen as the first server of the game. That means the first receiver of the game is the player who served to the first server of the game in the preceding game. In each game of a doubles match, the pair having the right to serve first shall choose which of them will do so. The receiving pair, however, can only choose in the first game of the match. When a pair reaches 5 points in the final game, the pairs must switch ends of the table and change the receiver to reverse the order of play. For example, when the last order of play before a pair score 5 points in the final game is A?X?B?Y, the order after change shall be A?Y?B?X if A still has the second serve. Otherwise, X is the next server and the order becomes X?A?Y?B. Expedite system If a game is unfinished after 10 minutes' play and fewer than 18 points have been scored, the expedite system is initiated. [37] The umpire interrupts the game, and the game resumes with players serving for one point in turn. If the expedite system is introduced while the ball is not in play, the previous receiver shall serve first. Under the expedite system, the server must win the point before the opponent makes 13 consecutive returns or the point goes to the opponent. The system can also be initiated at any time at the request of both players or pairs. Once introduced, the expedite system remains in force until the end of the match. A rule to shorten the time of a match, it is mainly seen in defensive players' games. Grips Though table tennis players grip their rackets in various ways, their grips can be classified into two major families of styles, penhold and shakehand . [43] The rules of table tennis do not prescribe the manner in which one must grip the racket, and numerous grips are employed. Penhold The penhold grip is so-named because one grips the racket similarly to the way one holds a writing instrument . [44] The style of play among penhold players can vary greatly from player to player. The most popular style, usually referred to as the Chinese penhold style, involves curling the middle, ring, and fourth finger on the back of the blade with the three fingers always touching one another. [44] Chinese penholders favour a round racket head, for a more over-the-table style of play. In contrast, another style, sometimes referred to as the Japanese/Korean penhold grip, involves splaying those three fingers out across the back of the racket, usually with all three fingers touching the back of the racket, rather than stacked upon one another. [44] Sometimes a combination of the two styles occurs, wherein the middle, ring and fourth fingers are straight, but still stacked, or where all fingers may be touching the back of the racket, but are also in contact with one another. Japanese/Korean penholders will often use a square-headed racket for an away-from-the-table style of play. Traditionally these square-headed rackets feature a block of cork on top of the handle, as well as a thin layer of cork on the back of the racket, for increased grip and comfort. Penhold styles are popular among players originating from East Asian regions such as China , Taiwan , Japan , and South Korea . Traditionally, penhold players use only one side of the racket to hit the ball during normal play, and the side which is in contact with the last three fingers is generally not used. This configuration is sometimes referred to as ""traditional penhold"" and is more commonly found in square-headed racket styles. However, the Chinese developed a technique in the 1990s in which a penholder uses both sides of the racket to hit the ball, where the player produces a backhand stroke (most often topspin) known as a reverse penhold backhand by turning the traditional side of the racket to face one's self, and striking the ball with the opposite side of the racket. This stroke has greatly improved and strengthened the penhold style both physically and psychologically, as it eliminates the strategic weakness of the traditional penhold backhand. Shakehand grip Forehand Backhand Shakehand The shakehand grip is so-named because the racket is grasped as if one is performing a handshake. [45] Though it is sometimes referred to as the ""tennis"" or ""Western"" grip, it bears no relation to the Western tennis grip , which was popularized on the West Coast of the United States in which the racket is rotated 90°, and played with the wrist turned so that on impact the knuckles face the target. In table tennis, ""Western"" refers to Western nations, for this is the grip that players native to Europe and the Americas have almost exclusively employed. The shakehand grips simplicity and versatility, coupled with the acceptance among top-level Chinese trainers that the European style of play should be emulated and trained against, has established it as a common grip even in China. [46] Many world class European and Asian players currently use the shakehand grip, and it is generally accepted that shakehands is easier to learn than penholder, allowing a broader range of playing styles both offensive and defensive. [47] Seemiller The Seemiller grip is named after the American table tennis champion Danny Seemiller , who used it. It is achieved by placing your thumb and index finger on either side of the bottom of the racquet head and holding the handle with the rest of your fingers. Since only one side of the racquet is used to hit the ball, two contrasting rubber types can be applied to the blade, offering the advantage of ""twiddling"" the racket to fool the opponent. Seemiller paired inverted rubber with anti-spin rubber; many players today combine inverted and long-pipped rubber. The grip is considered exceptional for blocking, especially on the backhand side, and for forehand loops of backspin balls. [48] The Seemiller grip's popularity reached its apex in 1985 when four (Danny Seemiller, Ricky Seemiller, Eric Boggan and Brian Masters) of the United States' five participants in the World Championships used it. [48] Shakehand grip ( Vladimir Samsonov ) Chinese penhold ( Ma Lin ) Traditional penhold ( Ryu Seung-min ) Types of strokes Table tennis strokes generally break down into offensive and defensive categories. Offensive strokes Hit A direct hit on the ball propelling it forward back to the opponent. This stroke differs from speed drives in other racket sports like tennis because the racket is primarily perpendicular to the direction of the stroke and most of the energy applied to the ball results in speed rather than spin , creating a shot that does not arc much, but is fast enough that it can be difficult to return. A speed drive is used mostly for keeping the ball in play, applying pressure on the opponent, and potentially opening up an opportunity for a more powerful attack. Loop Perfected during the 1960s, [4] the loop is essentially the reverse of the speed drive. The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke (""closed"") and the racket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. A good loop drive will arc quite a bit, and once striking the opponent's side of the table will jump forward, much like a kick serve in tennis. Counter-hit The counter-hit is usually a counterattack against drives, normally high loop drives. The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement ""off the bounce"" (immediately after hitting the table) so that the ball travels faster to the other side. A well-timed, accurate counter-drive can be as effective as a smash. Flip When a player tries to attack a ball that has not bounced beyond the edge of the table, the player does not have the room to wind up in a backswing . The ball may still be attacked , however, and the resulting shot is called a flip because the backswing is compressed into a quick wrist action. A flip is not a single stroke and can resemble either a loop drive or a loop in its characteristics. What identifies the stroke is that the backswing is compressed into a short wrist flick. Smash The offensive trump card is the smash. A player will typically execute a smash when his or her opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high or too close to the net. Smashing consists of using a large backswing and rapid acceleration to impart as much speed on the ball as possible. The goal of a smash is to get the ball to move so quickly that the opponent simply cannot return it. Because the ball speed is the main aim of this shot, often the spin on the ball is something other than topspin. Sidespin can be used effectively with a smash to alter the ball's trajectory significantly, although most intermediate players will smash the ball with little or no spin. An offensive table tennis player will think of a rally as a build-up to a winning smash. Defensive strokes Push The push (or ""slice"" in Asia) is usually used for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice: the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. While not obvious, a push can be difficult to attack because the backspin on the ball causes it to drop toward the table upon striking the opponent's racket. In order to attack a push, a player must usually loop the ball back over the net. Often, the best option for beginners is to simply push the ball back again, resulting in pushing rallies. Against good players, it may be the worst option because the opponent will counter with a loop, putting the first player in a defensive position. Another response to pushing is flipping the ball when it is close to the net. Pushing can have advantages in some circumstances, such as when the opponent makes easy mistakes. Chop A chop is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. [49] A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier push, taken well back from the table. The racket face points primarily horizontally, perhaps a little bit upward, and the direction of the stroke is straight down. The object of a defensive chop is to match the topspin of the opponent's shot with backspin. A good chop will float nearly horizontally back to the table, in some cases having so much backspin that the ball actually rises . Such a chop can be extremely difficult to return due to its enormous amount of backspin. Some defensive players can also impart no-spin or sidespin variations of the chop. Block The block is a simple shot, but nonetheless can be devastating against an attacking opponent. A block is executed by simply placing the racket in front of the ball right after the ball bounces; thus, the ball rebounds back toward the opponent with nearly as much energy as it came in with. This is not as easy as it sounds, because the ball's spin, speed, and location all influence the correct angle of a block. It is very possible for an opponent to execute a perfect loop, drive, or smash, only to have the blocked shot come back at him just as fast. Due to the power involved in offensive strokes, often an opponent simply cannot recover quickly enough, and will be unable to return the blocked shot. Blocks almost always produce the same spin as was received, many times topspin. Depending on the spin of the ball, the block may be returned to an unexpected side of the table. This may come to your advantage, as the opponent may not expect this. Lob The defensive lob is possibly the most impressive shot, since it propels the ball about five metres in height, only to land on the opponent's side of the table with great amounts of spin. [50] To execute, a defensive player first backs-off the table 46 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent's side of the table. A lob is inherently a creative shot, and can have nearly any kind of spin. Top-quality players use this to their advantage in order to control the spin of the ball. For instance, though the opponent may smash the ball hard and fast, a good defensive lob could be more difficult to return due to the unpredictability and heavy amounts of the spin on the ball. [50] Thus, though backed off the table by tens of feet and running to reach the ball, a good defensive player can still win the point using good lobs. However, at the professional level, lobbers will lose the point most of the time, so the lob is not used unless it is really necessary. Effects of spin Adding spin onto the ball causes major changes in table tennis gameplay. Although nearly every stroke or serve creates some kind of spin, understanding the individual types of spin allows players to defend against and use different spins effectively. [51] 4 phases in a backspin curve Backspin Backspin is where the bottom half of the ball is rotating away from the player, and is imparted by striking the base of the ball with a downward movement. [51] At the professional level, backspin is usually used defensively in order to keep the ball low. [52] Backspin is commonly employed in service because it is harder to produce an offensive return, though at the professional level most people serve sidespin with either backspin or topspin. Due to the initial lift of the ball, there is a limit on how much speed with which one can hit the ball without missing the opponent's side of the table. However, backspin also makes it harder for the opponent to return the ball with great speed because of the required angular precision of the return. Alterations are frequently made to regulations regarding equipment in an effort to maintain a balance between defensive and offensive spin choices. [ citation needed ] It is actually possible to smash with backspin offensively, but only on high balls that are close to the net. 4 phases in a topspin curve Topspin The topspin stroke has a smaller influence on the first part of the ball-curve. Like the backspin stroke, however, the axis of spin remains roughly perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball thus allowing for the Magnus effect to dictate the subsequent curvature. After the apex of the curve, the ball dips downwards as it approaches the opposing side, before bouncing. On the bounce, the topspin will accelerate the ball, much in the same way that a wheel which is already spinning would accelerate upon making contact with the ground. Again, the most significant change appears when the opponent attempts to return the bal"

The Scot reached the summit of the men's game when he overtook Novak Djokovic to become the world number one in November. Murray admitted that one of the key aspects that convinced him was Nadal's training routine and the chance to train in a competitive environment from a young age.

44," Tennis - Wikipedia Tennis From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about the sport. For other uses, see Tennis (disambiguation) . Tennis A tennis match at Wimbledon 's Centre Court (2007) Highest governing body International Tennis Federation First played Between 1859 and 1865, Birmingham , England Characteristics Contact No Team members Single or doubles Mixed gender Yes, separate tours & mixed doubles Type Outdoor Equipment Tennis ball , tennis racket Venue Indoor or outdoor tennis court Presence Country or region Worldwide Olympic Yes, Part of Summer Olympic programme from 1896 to 1924 Demonstration sport in the 1968 and 1984 Summer Olympics Part of Summer Olympic programme since 1988 Paralympic Yes, Part of Summer Paralympic programme since 1992 Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent ( singles ) or between two teams of two players each ( doubles ). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court . The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as "" lawn tennis "". [1] It had close connections both to various field (""lawn"") games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis . During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term ""tennis"" referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli 's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will ""go down to Hampton Court and play tennis."" [2] The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye . Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the ""Majors"") are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts , the French Open played on red clay courts , Wimbledon played on grass courts , and the US Open played also on hard courts.

[3] Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume (""game of the palm""), which evolved into real tennis , and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris ""around the end of the 13th century"". [4] In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. [4] In June 1316 at Vincennes , Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy , although there was also suspicion of poisoning. [5] Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. [5] Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France , who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace . [6] It wasn't until the 16th century that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called ""tennis"", from the French term tenez , which can be translated as ""hold!"", ""receive!"" or ""take!"", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. [7] It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis . [8] During the 18th century and early 19th century, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England. [9] Further, the patenting of the first lawn mower in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, world-wide, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others. [10] Origins of the modern game Augurio Perera 's house in Edgbaston , Birmingham , where he and Harry Gem first played the modern game of lawn tennis Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game pelota , which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham , England, United Kingdom. [11] [12] In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club in Leamington Spa . [13] In December 1873, British army officer Major Walter Clopton Wingfield designed and patented a similar game ; which he called sphairistikè ( Greek : ??????????? , meaning ""ball-playing""), and was soon known simply as ""sticky""  for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall , in Llanelidan , Wales. [14] According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist , ""Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis."" [9] [15] According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield ""popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game  and most importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874."" [16] The world's oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon Championships , were first played in London in 1877. [16] [17] The first Championships culminated a significant debate on how to standardize the rules. [16] Lawn tennis in the U.S., 1887 In the U.S. in 1874 Mary Ewing Outerbridge , a young socialite, returned from Bermuda with a sphairistikè set. She became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching British army officers play. [18] She laid out a tennis court at the Staten Island Cricket Club at Camp Washington, Tompkinsville, Staten Island , New York. The first American National championship was played there in September 1880. An Englishman named O.E. Woodhouse won the singles title, and a silver cup worth $100, by defeating Canadian I. F. Hellmuth . [19] There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in New York. On 21 May 1881, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association ) was formed to standardize the rules and organize competitions. [20] The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open , was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino , Newport, Rhode Island . [21] The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia . [22] Tennis doubles final at 1896 Olympic Games Tennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships dates to 1891 although until 1925 it was open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. [23] Thus, Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis. [17] [24] Together these four events are called the Majors or Slams (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball ). [25] Lawn tennis in Canada, ca. 1900 The comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now known as the International Tennis Federation (ITF), have remained largely stable in the ensuing eighty years, the one major change being the addition of the tiebreak system designed by Jimmy Van Alen . [26] That same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then ITF President Philippe Chatrier, ITF General Secretary David Gray and ITF Vice President Pablo Llorens, and support from IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. The success of the event was overwhelming and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at Seoul in 1988. [27] [28] International Tennis Hall of Fame at the Newport Casino The Davis Cup , an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900. [29] The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup , was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the ITF. [30] In 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. [24] [31] The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen . [24] [32] Once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments. [24] In 1968, commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era , in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis's popularity has spread worldwide, and the sport has shed its middle-class English-speaking image [33] (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists). [33] [34] In 1954, Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame , a non-profit museum in Newport, Rhode Island. [35] The building contains a large collection of tennis memorabilia as well as a hall of fame honouring prominent members and tennis players from all over the world. Each year, a grass court tournament and an induction ceremony honoring new Hall of Fame members are hosted on its grounds. Equipment Main article: Tennis technology Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls. Rackets Main article: Racket (sports equipment) § Tennis Wooden racket - c. 1920s The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability. Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines; [36] The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform. The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches (74 cm) in length and 12.5 inches (32 cm) in width. The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets. The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match. The rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been 32 inches (81 cm) until 1997, when it was shortened to 29 inches (74 cm). [37] A tennis racket and balls. Many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are some of the more commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist. The same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public. Balls Main article: Tennis ball Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. [38] Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation , and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.4168.58 mm (2.5752.700 in). Balls must weigh between 56.0 and 59.4 g (1.98 and 2.10 oz). [39] Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe . Although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the Far East . The relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region. [40] Miscellaneous Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear. Manner of play The dimensions of a tennis court Two players before a serve For individual terms see: Glossary of tennis Court Main article: Tennis court Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (11 m) for doubles matches. [41] Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can be no more than 0.8 cm ( 1 ? 3 in). [42] The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 m) high in the center. [41] The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the singles court on each side. The modern tennis court owes its design to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield who, in 1873, patented a court much the same as the current one for his stické tennis (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle. [43] Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. [44] Grass , clay , and hardcourts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found. Lines The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve. [45] The line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line. The boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position, he or she will have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. [46] A ball is out only if none of it has hit the line or the area inside the lines upon its first bounce. All the lines are required to be between 1 and 2 inches (25 and 51 mm) in width. The baseline can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide. [45] Play of a single point Main article: Point (tennis) The players (or teams) start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the server , and the opposing player is the receiver . The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players (or teams). For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the center mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will serve , although the receiver must play to the pace of the server. In a legal service, the ball travels over the net (without touching it) and into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a let or net service , which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a ""foot fault"", which occurs when a player's foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit. If the second service is also a fault, the server double faults, and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service. A legal service starts a rally , in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net, provided that it still falls in the server's court. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel past the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is still considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point. [47] Scoring Main article: Tennis scoring system ""Break point"" redirects here. For software term, see Breakpoint . Game, set, match Game A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "" love "", "" fifteen "", "" thirty "", and "" forty "", respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at forty apiece, the score is not called out as ""forty-forty"", but rather as "" deuce "". If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "" advantage "" for the player in the lead. During informal games, "" advantage "" can also be called "" ad in "" or "" van in "" when the serving player is ahead, and "" ad out "" or "" van out "" when the receiving player is ahead. The scoreboard of a match between Andy Roddick and Cyril Saulnier . The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., "" fifteen-love "") after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score. Set A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 75. If the trailing player wins the game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 76. A ""love"" set means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a 'jam donut' in the USA. [48] In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. ""62, 46, 60, 75"". Match A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. Recreational players may agree to play any number of sets, depending upon time availability or stamina. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match. [49] Only in the final sets of matches at the Australian Open , the French Open , Wimbledon , the Olympic Games, Davis Cup (until 2015), and Fed Cup are tie-breaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, leading to some remarkably long matches . In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase "" Game, set, match "" followed by the winning person's or team's name. Special point terms Game point A game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play. Break point A break point occurs if the receiver, not the server , has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 3040 or advantage), two (score of 1540) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point , double break point or triple break point , respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert. Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve , as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back . Except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set. Rule variations See also: Types of tennis match No ad From 'No advantage'. Scoring method created by Jimmy Van Alen . The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles. [50] [51] Pro set Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one ""pro set"". A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 88 (or 1010). These are often played with no-ad scoring. Match tie-break This is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tie-break (also called super tie-break ) is played like a regular tie-break, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tie-breaks are used in the Hopman Cup , Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon ) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup ) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play. Another, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles . This involves three players, with one person playing a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body. ""Australian doubles"", another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve. Wheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted. This rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches. It is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as ""one-up, one-down""), or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player. In such cases, the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only. Officials An umpire informing two players of the rules Main article: Official (tennis) In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair umpire (usually referred to as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made. [52] In some tournaments, line judges who would be calling the serve, were assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate the serve was out. This system was called "" Cyclops "". [53] Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the Hawk-Eye system. [54] [55] In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tie-break to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review . The US Open , Miami Masters , US Open Series , and World Team Tennis started using this challenge system in 2006 and the Australian Open and Wimbledon introduced the system in 2007. [56] In clay-court matches, such as at the French Open , a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball's impact on the court surface. The referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair). [52] Ball boys and girls may be employed to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no adjudicative role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This is the case for many school and university level matches. The referee or referee's assistant, however, can be called on court at a player's request, and the referee or assistant may change a player's call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out. Junior tennis Main article: Junior tennis In tennis, a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or Women's Tennis Association (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils , have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments. In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally. [57] Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments , which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers "

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The alleged match-fixing took place across Spain and Portugal, authorities said Police in Spain have arrested 34 people in connection with a suspected match-fixing ring in both Spain and Portugal. The arrested include six tennis players, the country's interior ministry said, without identifying any of the individuals. They are accused of deliberately arranging the loss of tennis games in at least 17 different events. Authorities said their earnings from the manipulation were over 500,000 (£420,420). A police spokesperson told the AFP news agency that players were offered between 500 (£419) and 1,000 (£837) to throw matches. ""Sometimes they promised 500 and in the end only paid 50. The players were above all the victims,"" he added. The players involved are relatively lower-ranked - all are outside the top 800 worldwide. In January, a joint investigation by the BBC and Buzzfeed News found widespread evidence of match-fixing at the top levels of world tennis. The revelations included 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 during the past decade, but were repeatedly flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) over suspicions they had thrown matches. All of the players, including winners of Grand Slam titles, were allowed to continue competing.

The trend is particularly strong on the womens tour: no fewer than five of the top 15 have handed out redundancy slips over the past fortnight. And on the surface of things, the most surprising decision is Johanna Kontas . Having climbed an astonishing 137 places in less than 18 months, the British No1 has sacked Esteban Carril, the man who guided her up that rocky path. Johanna Konta hits a backhand volley against Agnieszka Radwanska in Beijing Credit: REUTERS/Thomas Peter O r is it that surprising, after all? Look deeper and Carrils defenestration fits a paradigm already established by the last two women to storm the top ten from such a low base. Eugenie Bouchard went from No114 in April 2013 to No7 at the end of the 2014 season, then walked away from her guru Nick Saviano. Angelique Kerber fired Torben Beltz in similar circumstances a couple of years earlier. With girls in particular, the most likely time for a coach player split is after a big rise, says Naomi Cavaday, the former world No172, who is now a coach and broadcaster. Its a strong pattern and sometimes it comes down to players feeling like they have heard and implemented everything the coach has to say. Or after so long spent together in a highly pressurised environment, they have just had enough. Which female players have earned the most prize money in 2016? T hats the charitable explanation. Other tennis insiders suggest that players are quick to decide they have cracked the game, to conclude they are good enough to do without their mentor, and to balk at what tend to be increased wage demands. Financially, modern tennis is less like a pyramid than a hockey stick. Konta earned a queens ransom of £1.9m on the court in 2016 , but only a little over £100,000 in 2014, which would barely have covered her airline tickets, racket strings and massages. Carril  who took Konta on when she was still languishing on the fringes of the WTA tour  would hardly be human were he not looking for a hint of recognition in his wages. Watch | Watch: Johanna Konta beats Zhang Shuai to reach the semi-finals 01:28 T he interesting point is where Bouchard and Kerber are now. Perhaps you guessed it already. Like twentysomethings breaking up with a high-school sweetheart, they experimented elsewhere, realised what they had left behind, and revived their old flame in approved Friends Reunited style. Bouchard reverted to Saviano in May, saying He is almost like a second father figure to me, while Kerbers reunion with Beltz at the start of 2015 helped power her rise to the world No 1 spot. In January, they jumped into Melbournes Yarra River together to celebrate Kerbers first grand-slam title. So who will play Kontas sidekick in her next campaign? She will be trialling coaches over the next week at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton. One obvious contender would be Nigel Sears  an experienced guiding hand who lives, like Konta, in Sussex, and whose on-again, off-again tie-up with Ana Ivanovic appears to be in abeyance. Whatever decision Konta makes, the most poignant absentee from her camp this season will be the late Juan Coto, the mind coach who helped her manage the stress of touring life. Coto was only 47 when he passed away suddenly in November, to the shock and dismay of everyone who knew this considerate and insightful man. His loss put the annual frenzy of the Christmas coaching merry-go-round into perspective.

Gordon Reid won the Australian Open in 2016 Wheelchair Tennis Masters Venue: Lee Valley Tennis Centre Dates: 30 November - 4 December Coverage: Live coverage of the semi-finals and finals on Red Button, Connected TV and BBC Sport website. Highlights on BBC Two 13:00 GMT, Monday 5 December Gordon Reid has become the third British tennis player to finish 2016 as world number one, following fellow Scots Andy and Jamie Murray. Reid beat Stephane Houdet in the semi-finals of the NEC Wheelchair Masters to confirm his status. The 25-year-old, who won singles gold and doubles silver at the Rio Paralympics, won 6-2 6-1 at the Olympic Park in London. ""It feels incredible to be world number one,"" Reid told BBC Sport. ""It has been the best year of my career and to come here in the last tournament of the year and take the number one spot off Stephane shows I have earned it. ""Tomorrow's final is bonus territory."" Jamie Murray is part of the world's best men's doubles team with Brazilian Bruno Soares, while his younger brother Andy beat Novak Djokovic to cement his place as world number one in singles. Reid came into his match having only dropped one set in his three round-robin games and he was in superb form against the Frenchman, who occupied the top spot coming into the season-ending event. He raced into a 4-0 lead in the first set and with Houdet struggling to cope with his power and precision, he quickly wrapped up victory over the 46-year-old. He will face defending champion Joachim Gerard in the final after the Belgian beat Sweden's Stefan Olsson 7-5 6-3. Fellow Britain Andy Lapthorne lost his quad semi to Israel's Itay Erenlib. Lapthorne had won all six of his previous meetings against Erenlib but struggled to make an impact on Saturday and went down 6-2 6-4. ""I played horrible out there,"" the 26-year-old said. ""I think I am cursed here - I had bad luck in 2012 at the Paralympics and every time I come back here I don't play well. ""It's a difficult one to take, especially as I had so many people here to support me, but there is nothing I can do.""
